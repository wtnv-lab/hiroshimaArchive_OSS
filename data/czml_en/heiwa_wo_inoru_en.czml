        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">My Beloved Days</p><p class=\"body_en\">They held a thanksgiving party at the Grand Hotel after my daughter’s college graduation.  My daughter went to the beauty salon to get her hair done and got dressed in a formal kimono.  I took her to the hotel and the scene at the lobby was brilliant and colorful with many kimonos and formal dresses.  Fabric of the dresses ruffled, sounding like waves as the ladies walked by.  People’s laughter flooded the room.  I sat on a chair in the corner to take in the gorgeous scene.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn my youth, our home, our school, and our whole country were living in poverty.  My daughter’s generation is living a completely different life.  At graduation, the girls wore matching black gowns and walked to the music played by a pipe organ.  The choir sang a beautiful harmony.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOur graduation was held in a hall made out of scraps of lumber with humble wooden benches, and none of our clothes matched.  And yet mine was the same school as my daughter’s.  The difference time makes is astonishing.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDuring our school years, we worked at different munitions factories.  I was getting covered in grease while I made rifles.  And on August 6 many of my friends were burned in their monpe pants and air raid hoods.  My daughter and her friends, on the other hand, were given the freedom to study in peace to their hearts’ content.  They never had to change their goals for the war or censor their words and actions.  They were allowed to live and shine in their youth.  Our hands picked up hammers and operated lathes, as we were taught that the most important thing was the productivity of the factory and our dedication to agriculture.  We didn’t even open our books to study.  My daughters picked up pens, carried text books and literature, played the piano, and grabbed rackets as they chased after balls under the blue sky.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\n\nRain hit the tin roof and made a loud sound.  When it rained hard, you could barely hear the teacher’s voice.  Wind and snow blew in through the windows that had no panes.  The building was built out of rough panels of wood and was quite drafty.  The temperature in the building was no different from outside.  We wore our overcoats and scarves and rubbed our hands together as we took notes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter the war, I was spending time idly at my mother’s hometown in Shikoku.  I returned to school in January the following year.  It was wonderful to be studying in the atmosphere of freedom and peace.  I was poor in math and science, but loved Japanese and Japanese history.  Before the war ended, when my father died, people said that he left enough money for us to live comfortably for the rest of our lives.  But since our home was burned down and the currency values dropped after the war, there was nothing comfortable about our lives.  Many of my classmates graduated after four years but I remained until the fifth year.  I was blissful in my ignorance of how much my mother had to struggle to put me through the fifth year.  All I know is I was ecstatic when she said I could stay in school.  There were fewer than 40 students remaining in my class.  Nevertheless, I had a joyful year.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDuring our lunch breaks we would sit down in the fields of grass to talk or sing hymns.  Sometimes, during the war, we used to sing hymns at break time in the factories.  People never reproached us, since those who listened appreciated the beauty of the songs, but our school asked us not to say “Amen” at the end.  When I begun attending chapel at Jogakuin, the upperclass students  sang hymns in a chorus.  The beauty of the harmony enamored me as I listened to the different melodies.  Gradually the freshmen learned how to harmonize.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt parties such as the school’s 60th anniversary, goodbye parties for graduates and Christmas, every class participated by using their creativity.  We sang, performed Japanese and modern dance, and put on plays.  Our class performed plays such as The Oriole Princess, The Merchant of Venice, The Christmas Pageant, and sometimes plays in English.  There was a student who was an excellent dancer and she performed astonishing dances that I had never seen before.  The girls who transformed into characters in The Oriole Princess or Mother Mary in The Christmas Pageant were truly beautiful.  I borrowed my uncle’s detective’s uniform for the court scene of The Merchant of Venice.  We didn’t have one particular leader for these occasions.  We just worked as a group in concurrence.  We held a music festival at the current hall in Hiroshima University Minami Department and gathered a large audience.  The fifth year students participated in a chorus contest and the city volleyball play-off.\nThe most memorable of all these events was when we challenged ourselves to sing the Halleluiah chorus.  The teachers thought it would be difficult for us to sing the Halleluiah chorus, since it was a tradition we didn’t have the chance to learn from our upperclassmen, due to working at the factories.  But we were passionate about keeping the tradition alive.  Ms. Tizuru Fujisawa invited a music teacher from Kyushu to train us.  We recalled the days when we would listen to the upperclass students singing in beautiful harmony around Christmas time.  Their powerful voices could be heard all over campus.  We all strived to live up to their example.  The day of our chorus event at chapel, the forty fifth year students, joined by a few fourth year students sang Halleluiah at the close of the service.  We sang the joyful piece at the top of our lungs.  Everybody’s eyes glistened brightly.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’m not sure that we learned much academically during our fifth year.  I can’t recall exactly how much book knowledge we received that particular year.  But I reflect on the words of a certain writer who said, “Studying is an important element in school, but that something you learn through living the life of a student is vital.”  I feel as though I have learned that something during those days.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOf course, everyone is different.  Some graduated after four years and went on to study sewing and fashion design, some went straight to work, and others went to Manners School to prepare for marriage.  I’m not saying any of these courses of life is right or wrong.  But I must say three of my close friends were killed by A-bombing.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\n\n\nI spotted my daughter among the line of people who were going up the escalator.  She was joking around with her friends by pretending to slap one of them, carefully holding her arm up so as not to damage her long kimono sleeve.  Watching her laugh, I was wrapped in a sense of calm, as my memories of poverty during and after the war seemed to slowly fade into the background.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\nIn 1972, Jogakuin contacted me since the school was creating a collection of A-bomb memoirs.  I submitted my story and the following July they printed the collection with the title Summer Cloud.  The following month, I received a call from the Hiroshima branch of NHK (National Broadcasting Station).  They read my story in Summer Cloud and were interested in having me on television after they asked me some questions.  “We have two questions.  First of all, did you lose any family members in the bomb, and second, you really didn’t describe the horrible scenes from the aftermath of the bomb…”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI told them that my father had died young from an illness, I didn’t have any brothers or sisters, and my mother and I survived with minor injuries.  I also described to them how, after my house was destroyed, I was at a riverbank near Hakushima Choju Gardens and saw a burn victim and averted my eyes in terror.  Then I went due north to Hesaka, and most of the people I encountered were not badly injured.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“I see.  I remember how you described the state of your house when the bomb was dropped, how you longed for peace afterwards, what you want to leave to the next generation, and the experiences that shall not be forgotten.  All of these have left an impression, except, your whole story… well, it lacks impact.”  It was true.  There was nothing in my story that had shock value.  I politely declined to appear on TV.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEver since, I have been asked to tell my story a few times, but each time I remembered how I was told that my story lacked impact, and how I couldn’t argue with that.  I continued to decline telling my story with the excuse that I didn’t really have a pertinent tale.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI take my husband’s car to the hospital and clinic and drive by Jogakuin often.  I see the students in junior high and senior high school.  They walk along in twos and threes, wearing their refined uniforms and carefree smiles.  I’m sure these students have their own troubles and worries, but it is impossible to compare these girls’ lives with the students’ lives when I was young.  You blessed, happy girls...  I pray for your lives to be bright and wholesome.  I pray you grow in the glory of my alma mater.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt has been 75 years since I was gifted with life.  I continue to climb the hill of old age.  I was raised by my mother’s love, protected daily by my husband, and supported by my daughter.  I have always been surrounded by the kindness of others.  I know the warmth of friendship.  Each day, I am thankful.  There is only gratitude in my life.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI would like to close with an excerpt from a piece I self-published 14 years ago.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\nAfterglow</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThis spring, my husband transferred to Kure.  Once a week, I commute to Kure from Hiroshima.  As I pass through Mukainada Station and see the Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda), I am flooded with vivid memories of the days past.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe the Student Mobilization Workforce lined up in our groups after getting off the train.  We carried our air raid hood under one arm and the emergency bag under the other, straps criss-crossing over our chests.  We marched in cadence to the leading group’s singing “the young cherry blossoms are still merely buds…”  Tomoko was the leader of Class 1 of ninth grade, wearing a sailor’s shirt, navy blue monpe pants, and a white bandana around her forehead.  She walked at the head of the group as she took each step with determination.  We had been making rifles at Toyo Kogyo factory since the summer of our third year in High School.  The students, including Tomoko and me, labored at lathes, covered in grease and sweat.  The work clothes we wore were the same design and color (civil defense color) as that of the adult employees, and the only thing that distinguished us from them was the white bandanas around our heads.  Tomoko glowed as she worked with the machines.  She was the epitome of what a militarist young female citizen should be, passionate about improving productivity.  Those were the days of single-minded eagerness.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was assigned to the same class with Tomoko, for the first time, when we advanced to the ninth grade.  She was at the top of her class and took her studies seriously.  I was an imprudent student for the time of war, reading novels during class and taking piano lessons after school.  I lent the novel Takekurabe to Tomoko, who claimed to have no interest in books other than textbooks.  She returned the book with a note in it that read, “I understand well how the character Midori felt.”  I continued to lend her book after book.  Soon she was returning each book with a one-page remark.  She resonated with Fuji’s sentiment in Chidori, felt sorry for Otama in Gan, and was fascinated by Fujio in Gubijinso.  After all, she was an adolescent girl, complete with emotions and sensitivity.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDays of volunteer labor at the Army Ordnance Supply Depot (factory for military weapons) and the Army Clothing Depot (factory for military uniforms) increased, until finally the upperclass students had to leave school completely to join the Student Mobilization Workforce.  It was sad to leave our campus, uncertain when we would return.  I don’t remember exactly when, but Tomoko, along with people using the Kure and Sanyo Rail Roads, were transferred to work in the railroad warehouse in Hiroshima city.  At the goodbye party, Tomoko delivered an impressive speech.  She used the words “for my country” over and over.  But when we went to the changing room together, she showed her tears and asked me to please be well.  That would be the last time I saw her.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn that fateful day, Tomoko was on the eastern platform of the Ujina line at Hiroshima Station.  At 8:15 she was showered with a blinding flash and blown off the platform by the blast.  When a train with no one to put the brakes on entered the station and hit her, she landed on the tracks.  They said she kept her strong will until the end.  She stated her name to the person who picked her up.  As the person helping her gave her some water, scooped in the lid of a pencil case, she whispered her regrets about how she wasn’t able to help the country more.  She was 16.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nTaking a break from unpacking my husband’s belongings after the move, I hiked up the northern hill of Kure.  Tomoko had come to visit my home in Hiroshima twice, but I had never visited her home.  I could hear her voice, “Come visit me once.  I live in the house next to the small bridge by the grade school.”  It was not difficult to find her house.  I had heard through the grapevine that her mother was alive.  I remembered how she took my hand at the first school memorial service after the war, “You’re Tomoko’s favorite friend.”  Then I stopped in my tracks.  I imagined her mother had finally found a quiet and peaceful life after these long and heavy years.  Would it be wrong to visit her, just because I am feeling sentimental about my past?  I couldn’t cross the small bridge that led to Tomoko’s house.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe train station at Mukainada hasn’t changed.  At sunset I pass through this station on board the train to Hiroshima, with the western sky dyed red.  Back then, every day Tomoko would wave to me from the other platform in front of the western hedge while I stuck my head out of the train bound for Hiroshima.  Those days shall never return.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI sing in a murmur while the dark red wind blows through the open window.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“To be a martyr for our country’s affairs</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIs the students’ honor</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOh, our crimson blood boils”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe darkening town blurs into the mountains, silhouetted against the afterglow.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\n… 75 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">In Prayer</p><p class=\"image\"><img src=\"data/photo/michiko_takano2.png\"></p><p class=\"body_en\">I lived with my mother and grandmother.  My mother used to work in Fukuoka as an accountant in an advertisement firm for the western branch of Osaka Daily Newspaper.  In April of 1940, she was invited by the Hiroshima Jogakuin school principal, Zensuke Hinohara, to work in the accounting department at the school administration office.  We lived near Jogakuin on the 122th block of Nobori-machi.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I transferred to Nobori-machi Grade School and attended 5th and 6th grade.  It seemed natural for me to continue my education at Jogakuin High School before the war.  Back then the upperclassmen would play music during the morning chapel, and when our studies were over, hymns for the end-of-day ceremony could be heard from each class.  Upon being admitted to school, our first Arts and Crafts project was to sew a handbag to carry the Bible and book of psalms.  I was proud of the navy blue bag I made out of wool.  I used shades of pink and green thread to stitch on a four-leaf clover.  The freshman and sophomore students had classes, but once a month we would go to farms to harvest rice, or go to work in Army Ordnance Supply Depot (factory for military weapons), Army Clothing Depot (factory for military uniforms) and Army Provisions Depot (factory for military food cans).  About once a week we would go to the campus grounds in Mt.Ushita, and under the teacher’s guidance would tend to the farm.\nOnce we were in the 3rd year of high school, we were summoned to work at the Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda) where our upperclassmen were already commuting, as part of the Student Mobilization Workforce.  They divided us into groups, we put our work clothes on and made parts for weapons.  After taking a test, I was assigned to the 2nd General Army Headquarters Code Team.  In preparation for working for the Code Team, I went back to Jogakuin to be trained in mental computation by Ms. Mutsuko Yonehara.  After a week of training, I took a day off before going to work the following day.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The day of the bombing was the day I stayed home.  My mother had also taken the day off and was roasting beans in the kitchen.  After breakfast, my mother asked me to teach her hymn536 “Cast thy bread upon the waters” and we sang together.  I hadn’t had a good night’s sleep due to the air raid warnings the previous night, so I went to the family room to take a nap.  I woke to the sound of the B-29 fighter plane.  I went to the kitchen to tell my mother “It’s a B-29.”  Without looking up she said, “It must be one of our planes because there’s no precautionary warning.”  “Oh,” I said and went to the next room. At that moment there was a flash as if someone had lit a huge amount of magnesium on fire, and the house was blasted to pieces.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">For a moment I thought our house was hit directly with an Incendiary bomb.  But when I looked around the whole city was destroyed, and I saw people covered in gray ash standing in a daze on the street corners.  It was like seeing a scene from hell.  My family escaped being crushed under the house, but we were all covered in cuts.  My mother’s right upper arm had been cut from glass shards, my grandmother had a laceration of about 5 centimeters on her chest, and I had injuries on my back and forehead. I was also concerned because I was bleeding from my throat.  I gargled with water.  My grandmother said, “There’s a fire nearby,” so I gathered what I could.  The front door was flattened and I couldn’t reach my shoes1, so I walked out the house barefoot, stepping on roof shingles.  We headed to Sentei Garden (Shukkeien), which was our assigned evacuation site.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">When we arrived at the river behind Sentei Garden, there was a boat that came to take us to the other shore.  An NHK (National Broadcasting Station) employee, covered in blood, and a pastor’s wife from Nagarekawa Church climbed into the boat with my grandmother.  After crossing the river, the man rowing the boat passed out from his injury.  My mother and I found a small shack standing on the riverbank and took shelter.  We watched the city burn while we huddled together, praying and singing hymns.  We had a sheet of cloth, which we gave away to a nearly naked soldier whose clothes were torn off.  The only belongings we now had were a pair of scissors and the Bible.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">When the chaos subsided we walked through Sentei Garden and found Ms. Kusama, who taught at Nagarekawa Church, and staff member, Ms. T.  I was also delighted to find my classmate Ms. Fumiko Nakashima.  When the fire subsided, Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto, the minister of Nagarekawa Church, came to our rescue and took us across the river, riding in a traditional Japanese boat.  He had survived thanks to leaving town early in the morning.  Note about Tanimoto      prominently in John               Hiroshima.  Ms. Kusama, Ms. T, my mother and I traveled up the riverbanks filled with collapsed people to the eastern military training ground.\nThe relief workers were there, and the First Aid Stations were filled with people with serious injuries and full-body burns.  Since our injuries were relatively light, we gave up on receiving care.  I wasn’t able to eat the rice balls that were handed to us.  My mother ate her rice ball, saying it was delicious, and left to inform those at Sentei Garden of our whereabouts. She returned quite swiftly because she met someone headed to Sentei Garden and she asked them to deliver her message.  We left the eastern military training ground and headed to Ushita, all the while encouraging Ms. T, who had difficulty walking.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">We arrived at the T family residence in Ushita-minami.  The walls of the house had crumbled, but it hadn’t caught fire, and her four family members were all safe.  The T family was a member of the Nagarekawa Church, and despite our country being at war (Christianity was frowned upon), they had been hosting Christian meetings at their residence.  Ms. Kusama led the meetings, playing the organ and singing psalms.  I attended these meetings in the evening so I was close to the T family.  This day the father welcomed us and we stayed overnight.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">My mother had friends in Ushita, who had stored some bedding and belongings for her.  My grandmother, who was 65 years old, would go there every evening to sleep in safety.  Naturally, once my grandmother crossed the river, she went there to stay.  The family’s husband and daughter didn’t return the day after the bombing so the mother had been going into town in search of them.  We didn’t feel it was appropriate for us to stay there, so my grandmother stayed there alone.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I was delighted to hear the news of the end of the war on August 15.  That night we decided to move to our relative’s home in Fukuoka, Kyushu.  We thanked the T family from the bottom of our hearts and left Hiroshima.  We traveled with the wife and mother of my schoolteacher, Mr. Isao Matsushita.  We helped one another in the crowded train cars and arrived in Fukuoka the following night.  Mrs. Matsushita, passed away a month later from the aftereffects of radiation, despite seeming to be in good health at the time.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">When we arrived at our relative’s home in Chikushino City of Fukuoka, we caught them by surprise. There was no way of informing them that we were on our way, and they thought we were ghosts visiting in the summer night.  A while later we went for a physical exam at Kyushu University Hospital, and I was told that my white blood cell count was a low 2,000, but that there was no treatment for it.  On the way back we went to see School Principal Takuo Matsumoto who was staying in the hospital.  Principal Matsumoto asked my mother to please return to Hiroshima and help rebuild Jogakuin by continuing her work.  In mid-October, my mother took my grandmother to a friend’s house and returned to work in Hiroshima. She lived in a shack without electricity in the woods by the campus in Ushita.  The following year my grandmother’s stomach ulcers started acting up and she moved from Fukuoka to Hiroshima.  She became bedridden and died in August of 1946.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">In late October after the war, Jogakuin resumed classes in the grade school building of Ushita, but there were many who couldn’t return to school due to losing their homes and parents.  Most of the students my age graduated after 4 years, and there were barely enough students who remained for the 5th year of school to fill one classroom.  The campus was an unkempt field, and the school building was a shed with a tin roof.  But passionate teachers such as Mr. Tetsuo Kano and Ms. Chizuru Fujisawa came and taught us.  After completing my 5th year, I moved to Tokyo and entered Seiroka Women’s College (currently Seiroka Nursing University).  My friend, Ms. Nakashima, was entering a pharmaceutical college in Tokyo, so her father escorted us there.  She had to return to Hiroshima a month later due to tuberculosis.  I heard the news of her death while I was still in school, and cried alone in the dormitories.  Her death influenced my decision to specialize in tuberculosis prevention and treatment at my work in School Health.  Today, tuberculosis is completely curable with proper treatment. \nMy mother retired from Jogakuin when I left for Tokyo.  She began working at the treasury of the Japan Christian Community Office.  She was diagnosed with cancer of the large intestines at 85, and passed away in September of 1993 at the age of 88.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">When I was 22, after confiding in a doctor friend that I was an atomic bomb survivor, I was told that I wouldn’t be able to bear children.  Because of this, I never married.  But I have lived the last 60 years in contentment.  I believe being baptized at Nagarekawa Church in the 6th grade and keeping my Christian faith has helped me tremendously.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Today I am thankful for the wonderful gatherings I am privileged to attend at the Tokyo branch of Jogakuin Alumni Association.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 76 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

Having two young children with me (three and two years of age), I found it nerve wrecking to live in a home that had no bomb shelter, as the air raids continued day and night.  I decided to retreat further into the countryside and moved to Furuichi, where my mother’s mother-in-law lived.  On August 4, we hired a hand cart, loaded it with our meager belongings and slowly traveled along the road, along with my father-in-law. It took us 5 hours to reach the house in Furuichi-higashino-kitanosho, which was only 5 miles away.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe next morning I took my two children and traveled to Atago-machi to return the hand cart.  It was evening and my father-in-law recommended I stay in Ko-machi, where my old home was, but I felt uncomfortable since I had lost touch with my old neighbors since I got married.  I didn’t want to risk getting into a fix and not knowing where to go for help.  So I carried my younger child, took the older one by the hand, and caught the train to Furuichi.  It was 9 o’clock by the time we arrived back home, had some dinner, and went to sleep.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNext morning on August 6, I was cleaning up after breakfast when I heard a loud explosion and saw the mushroom cloud high in the western sky. The shutters flew off the  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nwindows, the sliding doors were knocked over, and I could no longer hear the radio that was playing on top of the shelf.  At first I thought that the munitions factory in nearby Gion was bombed.  Later I heard rumors that there was an incredibly powerful bomb that was dropped over the city of Hiroshima.  Nobody knew where to go for shelter.  The village was mainly rice paddies and had no bomb shelters.  However, the two banks of the Ota River were covered in bamboo so the villagers yelled, “Evacuate into the bamboo fields!” I put a summer-weight blanket over my head and was just about to run out of the house, when black rain began to pour. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe B-29 bomber planes were gone and we didn’t hear any further bombing.  We kept an eye on the mushroom cloud in the south, and made plans to evacuate after the rain stopped.  Then we watched as the burning city projected a red glow on the clouds.  The fire seemed to continue burning all day long.  I spent the night worrying about my brother and his family, who lived in the Ko-machi area of the city, but there was nothing I could do.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt wasn’t until the next day that we were told that the bomb, dropped over Hiroshima, was some sort of new, large-scale bomb.  It was even later that we learned that it was an atomic bomb.  Fortunately my mother survived, since she happened to be visiting my sister’s house in Nukushina to get food the day the bomb was dropped.  She was so worried about my brother and his family that the next day, on August 7, she went alone into town.  What she saw was devastating.  The only structures that remained were concrete walls and front gates; there were no remains of the houses themselves. Everything was a scorched field, except for the building of the Chugoku Electric Company, which stood eerily in the middle of town.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt one glance, you could see what used to be the city of Hiroshima: a whole city flattened, with scorched trees standing in ominous silence.  My mother stood in shock, looking over the ruins, when a neighbor happened to pass by and tell her that my brother and his family were in the Nisseki (Japan Red Cross) Hospital.  She rushed over and found many injured and burned victims lying in the front yard of the hospital.  She finally found my brother and his wife, holding their dead child in their arms.  Together, they carried the child back to Nukushina and arrived late at night.  As they walked, my brother and his wife, who still seemed to be quite calm and pulled together, started to speak slowly and little by little, of the atrocities they had seen.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“On the morning of the 6th, the air-raid warning had been lifted so I went out to the storage shed,” said my brother’s wife.  “My 6-year-old son was in the bathroom.  That’s when the bomb dropped, and in a flash the house collapsed to the west, and my husband, who was in the hallway on the east side of the house, was trapped because his leg was pinned under a fallen beam.  I didn’t suffer any injuries so I dragged my husband out and together we dug out our son from under the rubble.  We felt we should get as far away as possible from collapsed structures because of the danger of fire.  I remembered that there was a large fire cistern for fire control at the Hiroshima Icchu Middle School,30 meters away to the west, so we went and jumped into the water.  When the fire came, we dunked our heads every now and then to escape the flames.  The fires subsided in the evening but we felt that we had no chance of being rescued if we stayed.  So my husband walked, dragging his leg, and I carried my son to the streetcar line in front of the Chugoku Electric Company building. We sat down until some military men picked us up and took us to the Nisseki Hospital in Senda-machi. We spent the night in the front yard of the hospital, where my 6-year-old son breathed his last breath.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn August 8, I could hardly contain myself with worry but was too scared to go into the city since the B-29 bombers were still flying in the sky.  I figured that my sister in Nukushina might know something, so I decided to visit her.  I put my two children in a small cart that my father-in-law made and crossed the Ota River via boat from Furuichi-Higashino to Hesaka.  I climbed over the riverbank carrying my two children and walked down the farm roads that lead to Nukushina.  I saw people who were burned on their face, hands, and feet, walking almost unconsciously away, very slowly, very slowly, speaking not a word, from the city towards Yoshida and Kotachi.  I cannot forget the image of their anguished faces, puffed up to about twice the normal size, as they walked like ghosts, staggering, their arms held close to their chests.  I passed by a grade school where they were having a cookout, but these ghostlike people were probably unable to even think of eating, they walked by without even giving a glance.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt took us over 4 hours to arrive at my sister’s house.  I felt relief when I found my brother, his wife, and my mother there.  But I did not see my nephew.  The body of my nephew, who passed away on August 7, was taken to the crematorium with the help of the villagers.  Of course, there was no monk to give us a proper Buddhist burial. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBy this time my brother was suffering from the pain caused by his leg injury.  The company doctor came by and gave him a shot to numb the pain.  I felt bad about leaving my brother and his wife in such a state, but I didn’t think it was safe to stay in Nukushina in case there was another air raid so I returned to Furuichi.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThree days later when I went to Nukushina, my brother’s wife was in tears and told me that my brother had passed away.  On the fourth day she passed away as well.  I cursed the war and the atomic bomb.  In the end, my brother’s family died from the radiation.  I don’t think I’ll ever forget the feeling of anger and grief as we burned the bodies of my brother and his wife by myself.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn August 15 I heard over the radio that the war had come to an end.  Although I was relieved that I could finally walk around without worrying about air raids, I also cried in bitterness and sorrow over losing the war.  My thoughts and emotions went from concern for my mother, who had lost three family members, to the fear of uncertainty after the war, and then to great joy and relief that I had survived.  The next spring my children and I left Hiroshima to be with my husband in Tokyo.  Although I felt guilty about leaving behind my mother and the people in Ko-machi, I found peace in knowing that my other brother who lived in Fukuyama would find time in between work sessions to take care of and help my mother in Nukushina.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\n… 84 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

Even now I cannot forget the day when the red oleanders framed the hot summer sky.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn August of 1945 the war in the Pacific was intensifying by the minute and the American B-29 planes were bombing our country day in and day out.  Most of the larger cities were burned, and hushed rumors of our country’s defeat had spread.  These were tense days since most citizens were preparing for defeat but were still expected to fight for the country until the “day of victory.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was a student 17 years of age at that time.  In 1944 the ordinance for Student Mobilization Workforce was passed and the male students traded in their pens for guns and were sent off to the battlegrounds.  Middle school students went to work with high spirits to produce weapons in munitions factories.  We were assigned to the Hiro Navy Factory in Kure City.  I operated a 6-foot lathe that was larger than myself, and I dedicated my time and energy to making parts for warships. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn March they held an unprecedented graduation ceremony.  We attended the ceremony in white bandanas and monpe pants.  Appropriately enough for wartime, our distinguished guests were military engineers clad in their uniforms, complete with gold lace.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFor four months after graduation, we continued to commute to the factory from our dorms and work the same schedule as the military, for which there were no holidays.  We used to say our week consisted of “Monday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Friday.” It was indeed tough times and we worked diligently.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nUnexpectedly, at the end of July, those who proceeded to higher education were allowed to go back to school, a group of us returned to our homes in Hiroshima.  It was nice to be back home after about 14 months.  Finally I was allowed to go back to Jogakuin College, and I enjoyed life as a student for about a week.  There was nothing more precious than the lectures in the morning.  I studied hard and during the breaks I spent time talking with my friends.  It was such a joy to live the college life and the campus was lively.  Then came the day of destiny.\n\nThe Cruel Sight of Hell</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was a clear and hot day.  In the morning the temperature soared to 30 degrees Celsius.  The students of Jogakuin College were scheduled to join the Student Mobilization Workforce to work at Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda) in Mukainada the following day.  We were gathered at the Chapel for the morning service and were just about to head back to our homeroom in order to form new groups for mobilization.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSuddenly there was a giant blue-white flash (Pika) that struck my eyes like a fire pillar.  Immediately I was knocked with the blast(Don) to the floor by a thundering boom.  I felt something large crushing my body.  I’m not sure how many minutes passed…perhaps it could have been seconds. I must have fainted as I came to, grasping for air.  I wiggled frantically and realized that I could move my head, arms and legs.  I wasn’t in pain but I couldn’t see anything.  I wondered what had happened, especially because the air raid warning had ended a little while before.  In the swirl of confusion I told myself to relax.  I strained my eyes to look around and saw a tiny ray of light.  The air was dusty and it was suffocating.  I crawled to the ray of light with all my might.  I realized that the light was coming from the other side of a crack in a fallen door.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI lifted the door up and escaped.  I was safe!  Finally I realized that the whole building had collapsed and I was trapped under the Assembly Hall.  I saw many of my friends crawling out from under the rubble, injured.  They were all pale and in such shock that they couldn’t even speak.  Some had wounds on their heads: their hair was covered in pasty blood and looked quite awful.  Some were calling for their mother.  Most of us stood in a stupor, not fully comprehending what had just happened.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe town around us had also been altered completely.  Power lines were hanging everywhere and all the buildings were in ruins.  The roads were filled with debris. There was barely a clear path to walk along.  I realized that it wouldn’t be wise to walk barefoot, but most of my classmates had lost their shoes in the blast.  I searched hurriedly for the shoe cabinet under the rubble and brought back as many shoes as I could carry. Now that I look back, it is strange to me how oddly calm I was under such severe conditions.  Fortunately, I did not have a single injury.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the past, when I was in the Student Workforce in Kure City, the air raids continued day and night and every time the warning alarm sounded I would swiftly escape into the bomb shelter.  Once, when I didn’t make it to the shelter, I had a near escape by hiding under a flight of stairs, as the showering machinegun bullets shot through the walls and windows of the sheds.  I must have had really good luck, for countless times I had walked the tightrope between life and death.  Once again this day I escaped without an injury, while my friends with whom I chatted just ten minutes before were dead under the rubble.  Fate can be so fickle.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the confusion, my classmates and I started to head to the nearby Sentei Garden </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n(Shukkeien) which was assigned as a refuge.  That is when I heard another friend call out from under the rubble.  Startled, I ran closer.  Although they were not visible, I could tell from the amount of moaning that there were many people trapped under a collapsed wall.  We tried to lift the wall but with just a few girls’ strength it wouldn’t budge.  We called to our classmates under the wall to encourage them, but there was nothing else we could do.  Time passed in frustration.  We were at a loss as to what to do.  That’s when our school principal, Mr. Takuo Matsumoto, came by and told us to run away.  “It’s fortunate that you survived.  The fire is approaching so I want you to escape immediately to Mt. Ushita. All right?” He said, almost shouting.  We realized that the time had come to say goodbye to our friends.  We kept looking back, each time apologizing in our hearts and folding our hands in prayer.  I can still, to this day, hear my friends’ cries for help.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI ran into a friend who seemed to have broken her thighbone.  She was sitting down and could no longer walk.  She was much bigger than I was, but I mustered up the strength to hold her up and take her to Sentei Garden.  Sentei Garden was nestled in a quiet residential neighborhood in Kami-nagarekawa.  Usually it was a 5-minute walk from the school campus at the most, but it took us considerably longer since we had to walk over fallen pillars and power lines.  Step by step, we walked through the rubble, taking care not to lose our footing.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI looked around and noticed that there was something strange about the appearance of the people who roamed about.  I took a closer look and realized that most of them were nearly naked.  Their bodies were swollen red and some were so indistinguishable that it was hard to tell whether they were men or women.  Their skin was peeling off, giving off the false impression that there were rags or torn paper hanging from their limbs.  I couldn’t comprehend why they looked this way.  A few days later, I learned that these were the burn victims of the atomic bomb.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe grounds of Sentei Garden were filled with refugees.  They were all asking for water.  “My burns are hot.  Please pour some water on me.” I found a broken shingle and headed to the river to find some water, but stopped in my tracks when I wondered if it was the right thing to do.  I had heard that if you give water to burn victims, they die.  I saw some burn victims running towards the river screaming in madness, “It’s painful!  Somebody help!”  Most ran out of strength before they reached the water and so there was a mountain of dead bodies on the riverbank.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Where is the first aid station?  Is there a doctor somewhere?” A man yelled in the distance.  I felt helpless.  The training I had for air raid evacuations was meaningless now.  The whole city was destroyed and it was impossible to organize a relief operation.  But at that time, nobody knew of the scale of destruction and everyone thought that they were the only victims of a bombing.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHiroshima had the reputation of being a military city.  Near our school was an Army Corps of the West 2nd Troop, and two military training grounds were nearby.  I saw many soldiers who were among the walking-wounded.  The soldiers’ heads were burned except for the portion previously protected by their helmets.  It was horrific to see their gleaming eyes peeking out of their swollen faces.  The wide belt, tall boots and puttees between knee and foot were the only sign that indicated they were soldiers, for the rest of their uniforms had been burned off of their bodies.  I saw someone pick and devour a green tomato. It was all that was left in a stranger’s back yard.  The unripe tomato must have eased their thirst.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nGirls cried in search for their family and burn victims tumbled around in pain. I thought to myself that I was living in hell.  Soon the city was engulfed in fire.  The swirling flames swallowed everything in sight.  It was impossible to step into the city center.  Suddenly I became concerned for my parents and sisters and became lonely.\n\nBlack Rain</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I got to the riverbank behind Sentei Garden, the sky turned dark and large raindrops started to fall.  The shower of rain was black, for some reason and my white blouse turned gray.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe Kyobashi River behind Sentei Garden was one of the fastest flowing rivers in Hiroshima, churning devilishly at certain times.  The tide was high and the water rose to the dykes on either shore.  My friend and I dove in without hesitation, not even bothering to walk to the bridge to cross the river.  We held onto a piece of a wooden pillar drifting in the water and used it for flotation as we swam.  We struggled with all our strength not to get swallowed in the rapids and make it to the other side.  We walked to Mt. Ushita, through the burning city.  The heat from the flames dried our clothes in about five minutes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOur school had a large campus ground at Mt. Ushita. I remember how the grounds served as a place for exercise and recreation, land for farming and burning coal. During the war the students and teachers worked in cooperation to produce food.  This was a valuable experience.  No sooner had I arrived at Mt. Ushita than we heard that the fire was spreading into the mountains from the town below.  I didn’t want to get trapped in a mountain fire.  My friend Ms. M, who had been traveling with me from school, invited me to stay at her home on the outskirts of Hiroshima.  I was a little concerned about leaving my family behind, but she convinced me that it was important for us to be safe.  Ms. M’s family had been taking refuge in Naka-fukawa along the Geibi railroad.  We heard that the road that led to Hiroshima Station was on fire, so we had to climb over Mt. Ushita to get to her home. I didn’t have a watch so I didn’t know exactly what time it was, but my guess was it was well into the afternoon by the time we started hiking.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMs. M and I, along with another friend, Ms. T, started up the mountain on an unfamiliar trail.  We walked for a few hours only to realize that we had gotten off the trail completely and were lost.  Tree branches had torn our clothes and we were covered in scrapes.  Somewhere along the road we had lost our shoes.  We hadn’t eaten since morning, but we were so concerned about fleeing to safety that we didn’t feel hunger.  Soon the sunset and the day grew dark.  We quickened our stride, as if to outpace fear and anxiety.  We shared words of encouragement.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen we finally saw the dim light of Hesaka Station in the distance, my heart filled with relief.  We could hear the train whistle far away.  The three of us ran towards the station since we didn’t want to miss the train. The train to Miyoshi was packed to the brim with refugees.  We squeezed our way in.  Most of the passengers were injured and many lay on the floor.  I heard them groaning.  The heat in the dimly lit train car was unbearable.  Even worse was the nauseating smell from the burnt skin.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe arrived at Naka-fukawa Station and Ms. M led us, stumbling in the dark.  I believe it was after 7 in the evening by the time we finally made it to her house.  Her parents greeted us warmly.  Suddenly, all of the stress from the day and a sense of relief hit us and we cried in each other’s arms.  That was the first night in a year that I slept so well into the morning.\n\nHeaps of burned bodies</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEarly the next morning Ms. M’s father offered to take his bicycle to Hiroshima to check on our homes.  He didn’t want us to be in danger.  We washed our clothes in the stream behind the house.  It was a nerve-wrecking day, worrying about the wellbeing of our families.  In the evening Ms. M’s father brought home some news. He told me that although my house was burned to the ground, all of my family members escaped safely.  My chest swelled with joy, but I was unable to express my delight when we were told that Miss T’s family was missing.  Ms. M and her family kindly let us stay another night.  Once I recovered my energy, I was anxious to see my family’s faces and I left in a hurry, barely saying a proper thank-you.  My heart was already in Hiroshima.  I took the train from Naka-fukawa to Yaga Station and walked the rest of the way into the city.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I arrived, I was shocked to see that the whole city was burned down to the ground.  I could see the mountains of Koi to the west, from Hiroshima Station, as if they were within arm’s reach.  There was nothing about the city that looked familiar.  As far as the eye could see, everything had turned into a pile of rubble and gray ash.  There were also mounds of bones here and there.  Perhaps they marked schools or military camps.  There were countless black bodies lying everywhere, and the numbers only escalated as I approached Aioi Bridge near the epicenter.  Their arms covered their heads and their faces were distorted in anguish.  I felt a terrible anger boiling inside of me.  I cannot describe the bitterness I felt towards the cruelty that, in a split second, put people into such a state.  Hiroshima, nicknamed the City of Water for its seven rivers, had many bridges.  Most of these bridges were crumbled or burned down and I walked a long way to find bridges that would take me across the river.  When I passed through Tenma-cho, I found my cousin cleaning up the rubble of his house.  My brother-in-law was with him, and for the first time since the bombing I was reunited with my family.  I cried, no longer able to contain my emotions.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI finally arrived at the burned remains of my home in Ogochi-machi.  There was nothing that resembled the house that I left that morning on August 6.  Everything had turned to ash.    The only thing to indicate that I was on the grounds of my house was the granite pillar that marked my father’s business at the front gate.  I stood in a daze.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Mother, I’m home,” I tried yelling.  My mother and sister jumped out of the bomb shelter.  My mother cried with joy, her face in wrinkles.  “You’re safe!  I didn’t think you would have survived,” she said.  My father was safe, too.  On any given day at that hour in the morning he would have been in the home office and would have been crushed under the building. But as luck would have it, that day he left early in the morning to go to Fukuyama on business.  He saw the flash near Hongo Station of the Sanyo Honsen Railrroad.  After he finished his business he hurried back but was unable to enter Hiroshima.  He spent the night on the outskirts and returned to the field of ruins the next day.  Every time he saw a girl’s body lying on the ground, he checked to see if it was one of his daughters.  He didn’t even dream that I would have survived, much less escape unscathed, since my school was only about 1 kilometer away from the epicenter.  At home, during the blast, my mother had been cleaning the hallway and was safely wedged in between beams and frames.  Neither of my sisters, who were also home, was badly injured.  It was miraculous that every family member survived.  Many others in Hiroshima envied our good fortune.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy father’s company was a subcontractor for the military and dealt with lumber.  The lumberyard burned for three days straight, and the basement filled with ashes.  The fire had still been burning in a dim glow when I first arrived home.  I lost two of my aunts.  One lived near the epicenter and was crushed by her house; the other escaped but the fire caught up with her because she had broken a leg.  We never recovered her remains, or found out where she breathed her last. My brother-in-law, who married my sister after the war, was in Kako-machi at the time of the bombing. He nearly died from the countless shards of glass that pierced through his skin.  Although he miraculously survived, his health suffered and he spent the rest of his life going in and out of the hospital.  He died at age 46 of cancer.  I remember him telling me that years after the bomb he still had some glass in his body.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMany families were wiped out near the epicenter.  In those days families sent the young and elderly in refuge to the countryside.  And yet the family members who claimed to be strong enough to remain in the city were dead, leaving the weak behind.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere were many casualties from my school.  I was told that the juniors and teachers who were working at the building demolition sites were all killed.  A single atomic bomb wiped out the lives of 200,000 to 250,000 people.  \n\nSudden Death from an Unknown Cause</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nShortly after, the war ended.  Since we were living in a shelter without even a radio we heard the news a day later.  We were too busy caring for the injured people who stayed in our shelter to be disappointed about losing the war.  Rather, I remember feeling relief that I no longer had to live in fear for my life. The sirens and air raids stopped precisely on August 15.  The eerie searchlights in the sky disappeared and nights were calm again.  Peace returned to the ruins of Hiroshima.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBut everywhere, the people of Japan were battered from hunger and fatigue.  People’s hearts were degenerated in the chaos after the war.  In Hiroshima, many died before their wounds healed.  Many seemingly healthy and uninjured people developed a sudden high fever and diarrhea.  Their bodies deteriorated, while their gums bled and hair fell out.  People died under trees and half-broken buildings, as they called their family’s names from their shelters.  I was told that those who escaped to the suburbs and evacuated to refugee camps didn’t receive proper care for their burns and injuries since there was a severe shortage of bandages and medicine.  We cremated some bodies at my father’s factory.  It was a simple cremation, using pieces of wood scavenged from the ruins with a tin sheet over it.  I still remember staring fixedly at the blue-white flames.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nPeople began to return to the city and started building sheds out of tin sheets.  They lit candles inside of these makeshift homes and sometimes you would even hear laughter.  We were poor but our spirits were recovering. My brother returned from the battlegrounds and our family spent the next three months in the bomb shelter.  We were young and unafraid.  When the time came to rebuild our home, the women of the house joined in with hammers and a plane.  American soldiers who passed by the construction site would park their jeep and watch the strange sight of women doing hard labor, but I think this was pretty common for the time.\nLest Not Forget the Atomic Bomb</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAlthough some experts predicted that Hiroshima would be barren for 70 years, our city recovered superbly after the war ended.  The world was watching the city on which the first atomic bomb was dropped.  The citizens who survived united and strived for revitalizing the town.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe following spring brought blue-green sprouts of grass, and even the scorched trees had young branches growing out of their roots.  I was delighted to see green in our city again.  The appearance of mountains and rivers now resembled the days before the war.  The vegetation turned color with the change of seasons and reminded us of the joy of being alive.  Perhaps only those who have experienced war really understand the sacred and precious nature of peace.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I look back at our history of the last half-century and reflect upon the problem of nuclear weapons, I realize the importance of speaking about the tragedy that Hiroshima experienced.  There are many who still suffer from the aftereffects of radiation exposure.  I live in constant fear of falling ill from the radiation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy friends who ran to safety with me that day died in their 50s, one by one.  I remember how hard we worked through the chilling nights in the Student Workforce; how we labored at the factory production line without wiping the sweat from our brows; and how we escaped death during the bombing.  After fighting so hard to stay alive, I can only imagine that they must have died with regret that the happy days of their lives were too short.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the 25th anniversary of the bombing, I finally had the chance to revisit my school.  The grounds in Mt. Ushita had been transformed into a beautiful college campus, and the mountain trails were now paved over, complete with a bus route.  The surroundings of the campus were abundant with nature.  I stood in the quad and reflected on the passage of time with deep emotion.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEvery year on August 6, I become restless.  Even though I still live in Hiroshima, this anniversary day fills me with the urge to run away.  Now that I have aged, I watch the memorial ceremony on television.  I pray to the gong of the Bell of Peace, in memory of all that were sacrificed.  I pray that we will all live in peace.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 77 years old\n</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

As I looked up, wondering what it was that I just saw, I heard a hissing sound and the room blacked out.  What followed was destruction beyond description.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy Husband, Tokuichi Masuda, an Electives’ teacher at Hiroshima Women’s High School, was off from work that day.  He was supposed to have gone to pick up some lumber from the building demolition sites,  but decided he would rather stay home.  This dampened my mood quite a bit.  In those days there was no rationing of firewood and we were responsible for finding our own.  This chore required us to pull a bicycle cart with a flat tire to a place far away, where they were tearing down houses to prevent fires from spreading.  Had we decided to leave our home in Furue and head into the city that morning, we would have been in  Koi area when the “Pika”  was dropped and probably would have lost our lives.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI prepared breakfast and went to call my husband, who was copying Buddhist prayers in the room facing the street.  My mother was visiting and had arrived the day before.  She was carrying my baby daughter and talking to the children in the neighborhood in front of the house.  She came in because the baby had wet her diapers. Just when I was helping her change diapers in the living room, I heard a plane and saw the orange flash.  I thought it was strange because the air raid warning had been lifted, and just as I lifted my head I heard a loud noise and everything went pitch black.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy husband, my mother, and I fell flat against the floor to protect the baby. When I managed to look around, I found the house covered in shattered glass.  All of the furniture was completely knocked over. Fortunately, we were not injured because the glass and broken furniture were scattered away from the area where we took cover.  Had my mother still been on the street, she and my daughter would have surely been blown away.  The front room where my husband sat, just moments before, was also covered in shattered glass.  He was sitting by two upright pianos with their lids open, and as I looked out at the glass shards digging into the pianos, I shivered at the thought. It could easily have been my husband’s body that was covered in glass.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs I put my daughter on my back and started to move the debris, I heard some commotion outside.  I went out and observed the strangest sight I had ever laid eyes on.  People were running towards me, and it took a moment to make sense of what I was seeing.  Their skin dangled from their hands, their eyes and face were bright red, and their bodies were covered in blood.  Those who lost their straw hats had heads that looked like they had just gotten a shave, with a few patches of hair remaining.  These red bodies were running into the clinic of Tada Pediatrics across the street from my house.  Dr. Tada’s wife, Mrs. Toshiko Tada was in the 29th graduating class of Hiroshima Jogakuin High School and was a classmate with Ms. Hamako Hirose.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNaturally, the explosion had destroyed the clinic as well, and there wasn’t even a single place to lie down.  The injured found doors and other surfaces to lie down on, but the doctor seemed helpless without any medicine.  He said he didn’t have any bandages so I gathered some curtains and any other cotton cloth I could find in my house and brought them over to the doctor.  Water was in high demand, but we didn’t have any running water so we drank the water in our tank.  As I returned to my home it began to rain.  I gathered the laundry that was hanging outside, but the rain had stained everything black and scorched holes in the clothes.  This was the black rain.  I managed to clear out a space in the house to lay my daughter down.  I heard Buddhist chanting from my neighbor’s house in the back.  A voice that must have belonged to someone suffering from their injuries chanted, “Namuami-dabutsu” (O, merciful Buddha).  Soon the weakening voice disappeared.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe city was engulfed in flames and had dyed the sky a hellish red.  The neighbors were busy trying to find their families and were giving reports of the missing.  My husband lost his niece and I lost my aunt.  My husband worried about his parents, who were in refuge in the countryside, and so he packed some food and water and left the next day to find them.  Luckily, his family was alive, but his father had a huge burn on his chest that had become infected, so two days later my husband returned and took a first aid kit containing antiseptic and tweezers to help his injured family.  There were no vehicles to take him back and forth to the countryside and the tire of our bicycle was flat.  In the end he took a garden hose and used it as a tube for the bicycle.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOnce at his fathers’, my husband sterilized the wound and removed the pus.  People would squirm and remark, “How could you do such a cruel task!”  But thanks to my husband’s labor and constant commuting to treat his father’s wounds, the infection didn’t get infested with larva and the wound healed into a scar.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhenever my husband commuted to the countryside in the east, he avoided the area by the city hall.  The first time he rode through the city center, there was such an offensive smell that from then on he took the long way around.  Later we heard that most of the people who gathered in the city center to treat the injured either died or got sick from breathing the toxic gas in the area.  I worried that my husband might lose his hair from the radiation but he never did.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy mother took ill for a while, and when I heard that she had a bloody stool, I took her to the doctors, after which she soon healed.  My daughter was fine.  My house was in shambles but we had enough shelter to sleep in, and many people came by.  I remember there were two men whose families were missing and every day they packed some food and water and set out to search for them.  One of the men found his wife and daughter (Jogakuin Junior High School 1st ) taking shelter by the river under a bridge.  He brought them home with delight.  But his happiness was short-lived as unfortunately his daughter soon passed away and his wife died shortly after.  We were hoping that she would survive since she seemed to suffer only minor injuries, but the toxic gas must have overpowered her.  The other man never found his wife or his child.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nKogo area, populated today with large buildings and many homes, used to be farm fields with a fair amount of snakes.  Parts of these fields were used as crematoriums.  Bodies from the city were brought there, piled under firewood, and burned.  When they ran out of rationed firewood, they used tin sheets.  My husband, along with other men who lost their families, helped burn the bodies.  I can hardly describe the horror of this scene.  Bodies were piled high, one on top of the other, and it was impossible to distinguish one person from another.  I’m sure the smell was dreadful but we had become so immune to the awful stench that permeated the whole city of Hiroshima that we barely noticed.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA friend and her son stayed with me for about six months.  Once things calmed down, I went to search for my friend Ms. Shizuko Narita (45th graduating class of  Hiroshima Jogakuin High School), who had taken refuge in Takasu.  She and I were in the same class at the Seiroka Nursing School, and she had been teaching at Hiroshima Jogakuin High School.  I learned that she was in the school chapel the day of the bombing and vanished, along with many others from my class.  Even the ones who survived the bomb passed away from breathing the toxic gas, as they went into the city to rescue victims.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy mother, who had experienced the bloody stool, lived until she was 80 years old.  My daughter is well.  My husband passed away 11 years ago.  Twenty-three years after the war we moved to Kokutaiji-cho, where we still reside today. When we moved there, the area had no real homes or buildings to speak of and the City Hall was just a hut, which at one time had caught on fire.  When they began to repair the streets, they occasionally found bones that belonged to the A-bomb victims.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nToday you can find a memorial for the students next to the Kokutaiji Middle School.  When I moved to Kokutaiji, I could see all the way to Hiroshima Station, Hondori, and Kinza-gai.  We used to comment that we would know if one were to waive a flag in Hondori.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt is surprising to see how much of Hiroshima has recovered compared to those days after the war.  There were rumors that it would be 70 years before any vegetation would grow on Hiroshima’s soil, but weeds started growing in our backyard almost immediately.  Those weeds were precious food to us during the war.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI had to part with the two upright pianos that were in the bombing.  We had painstakingly tried to keep them in tune, but my family decided it was time to get a grand piano when we moved to Kokutaiji-cho.  It is truly a wonder that I am still well.  I pray for the souls of the dead.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n--- 84 years old </p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

My father, who was working abroad, felt it was impossible to live in a foreign country with three children and decided to return to Japan.  Shortly after, he left his company job and moved to Nagoya to become vice principal of a trade school.  Later, his superior asked him to move to Hiroshima to become school principal.  This made Hiroshima the second home for our family.  I imagine Hiroshima was still quite small at the time, and there were only two 5-year schools.  One of them was Hiroshima Jogakuin High School, the other, Kenjo High School for Women.  Since I was transferring during mid-semester, I enrolled in the third grade at Hiroshima Jogakuin High School.  This private school had an atmosphere quite different from that which I had experienced before in public school, and I made friends quickly and without much difficulty.  I’m sure the fact that we were free and encouraged to do any kind of sport contributed to my easy transition into the new school.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter I advanced into electives, the high school gym teacher, Mr. Tadahiro Hirono, pointed out that there was a shortage of gym teachers and recommended that I became one.  I spoke with my father about it and at 19 years of age became a teacher.  The school principal, Mr. Zensuke Hinohara, arranged for me to study as an apprentice and teach the students. By the time June rolled around I was running around as a full-blown teacher, having passed the exam held by the Ministry of Education.  I look back fondly at that time of my life when I took many workshops and studied with passion.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy father died on the job.  I transferred from a private to public school during the 1944 reconstitution.  I took a position at Funairi High School, which was about 10 minutes away from home.  This co-ed school had an unusual and progressive unit system.  This wonderful arrangement allowed students in the 10th to 12th grades to elect their own classes.  Unfortunately this system was replaced when the school principal changed.  Even today the graduates of the elective system come together once a year to reminisce about the old days and to talk about what misfortune it is to see how much has changed.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy mother and I moved to Tokyo in 1956 to live with my grandmother.  I worked as a manners teacher.  Before retiring at the age of 68, I worked for eight years under Dr. Wataruko Kawase, on the faculty of Seishin University and poetry teacher to the Empress.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt is the 60th anniversary of the A-bomb this year.  Since my husband and I were both teachers we have many people that support us in our partnership of spreading love and peace to the world.  Thankfully my body is still strong and I am able to go dancing three days a week with the young people.  The types of dancing we do are folk dance, quadrille (a British dance from the 17th century), and hula…  This year I dream of going to Hawaii for a hula workshop.  I also periodically counsel mothers.  The year before last I had a chance to meet former United States President Jimmy Carter to pray for peace.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI would like to continue my support for the alumni association.  I pray for the development of the association; may it prosper.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nPost Script… August 6, 60 years ago</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI left my home in Funairi Kawaguchi-cho slightly earlier than usual.  I passed by some 7th and 8th grade students who were helping out at the building demolition sites.  (They were probably killed instantly since they were so close to the epicenter of the bomb).  From the Yokogawa station of the Kabe line, I headed towards Oshimo Middle School for women in Gion-cho.  The air raid warning had been lifted, and I arrived at the faculty room.  I heard the B-29 bomber plane and a loud explosion, then a flash of yellow followed by a shattering noise.  As soon as I slid under a desk I heard someone yell to get to the classroom and I rushed out to the hallway.  The rest of my memory is foggy.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI found myself under the awning of a house along the main road with a student whose eyes were pierced by glass shards.  Someone came out of the house and took in the injured student.  I think it was dark outside.  I headed towards Funairi-kawaguchi-cho but the road was gone.  People were roaming about or squatting. All of them were naked.  Their clothes were burned off.  They just silently followed the person in front of them.  Nobody spoke.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI came by an area with dead bodies everywhere.  From time to time, I would hear a frail voice say, “Sister, spare some water?”  I turned my water flask upside down and shook it. I threw it away when I realized it was empty.  I don’t know what happened to my backpack or my shoes.  I kept walking on the road-less path, gauging my location by the bridges that remained over the rivers.  There were no buildings that I could use as landmarks.  People leaning over the handrails of the bridge and the horses were all black.  They were also bloated.  I’m sure I looked like a ghost too.  Then, for some reason, I came by a shrine near Sumiyoshi Bridge. “Maybe I’ll find someone from home…” I thought.  I looked at people’s faces.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI met someone from the neighborhood I didn’t recognize.  They said “Ms. Fujiwara, since your home has burned down, we see that you’re lost.  Your family is injured and has evacuated to the Yuishin temple.”  I walked through the rubble, winding and turning, and finally found my parents covered in bandages.  My sister, who was home from school that day, was covered in burns and her face and upper body were completely black.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat night, the temple’s yard was filled with the caregivers and the injured. The injured whimpered and moaned, creating a hellish scene.  The next day I borrowed a bicycle cart from somewhere and took my sister and mother to the evacuation site at a school in Yasu.  For the next few months I took a leave of absence from work to care for them.  There were many classrooms and all were filled with the sick and injured.  Many died.  Many lost their hair.  Those with burns had larva growing in their wounds.  I picked my sister’s larva out with chopsticks.  This was a living hell.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSixty years later in 2005, I still remember this day as if it were yesterday.  We must never repeat such a catastrophe.  Each year on this day, my tears flow endlessly.  I will pray, as long as there is life.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n…83 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I was getting ready to leave for the Tax Office, near Hatchobori, where I worked as a Mobilization Workforce Student.  There was a bright flash and an extremely loud noise and then the house crumbled.  For a few minutes I was in darkness. I lay on the floor, covering my ears and eyes, unable to move.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tI waited for some light to shine through the rubble and dug myself out. I went and stood in the yard and looked around.  All of the houses in the area had collapsed and the roofs were sprawled on the ground.  By the time I got to the streetcar tracks, I was completely surrounded by fire. So I took the only way out, which led me in the direction of Yoshijima.  There were many people around me escaping the fire, but no one spoke.  We all walked with a horrified look across our faces.  Many people were swaying as they walked. They were naked apart from rags hanging from their outstretched arms.  I was not thinking very clearly and my mind could not comprehend why they would all be naked. I mostly remember the destroyed houses and water squirting out of the broken pipes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI arrived at a small airport near Yoshijima that was crowded with refugees.  There were many female students whose clothes were burned off. Their skin was puffed up from the burns and they had boils bubbling up on their skin. They were crying, “It hurts, it’s so painful.”  What I thought were rags, hanging from their bodies, was actually burned skin that had peeled off from the extreme heat.  Some people were completely swollen and others had been seriously injured.  It was an awful sight.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tMy brother-in-law began treating patients who were ill.  At first glance, most of them seemed fine, except for the purple spots on their skin.  But this was the aftereffect of radiation exposure, and within a couple of weeks they ended up dying a painful death.  Grade schools everywhere were made into first-aid stations and housed many people, but there was a severe shortage of medicine and most just lay on the floor with their open wounds full of maggots.  Large holes for cremation were dug at the campsites, but there weren’t enough for all of the bodies.  Soon they took handcarts full of bodies and burned them by the river as if they were just pieces of lumber.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA friend confided in me about how she grabbed a burn victim by the arm to help them, but the meat on the skinless arm crumbled like tofu.  She couldn’t forget another friend’s call for help from under the rubble as she ran away from the fire that was about to engulf her friend.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tI was a mere 800 meters away from the epicenter and yet survived without harm because I happened to be inside my house.  I give thanks for my fortune as I reflect on the atrocities of the war and the atomic bomb that, in a single moment, took so many innocent lives.  I am keenly aware of the insanity of war that breeds fear and invades people’s hearts: I pray that wars such as this are never repeated.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tAfter the bombing, the city of Hiroshima burned for five to six days.  Then people began to build tin huts and eventually houses on the land that was thought to be barren for 75 years.  I believe it is important to remember the strength of humankind.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n(Published in the Hatsukaichi Church News, August 4, 2002)</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

Students of the junior and senior years of Hiroshima Jogakuin High School before the war graduated at the same time.  Some of us who graduated from the junior year went on to make guns at Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda).  Others continued to pursue their academics at the College or joined the 2nd General Army Headquarters to work in the communication battalion.  Whatever choice my classmates made, at 15 and 16 years of age the young women of Jogakuin all worked diligently. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the morning of August 6, I was waiting for the streetcar at Tokaichi Station for a long time.  The streetcars were temporarily delayed due to the air raid warning earlier on.  I squeezed into the packed streetcar and was riding by Dobashi.  There was an orange flash for a split second, followed by a thundering loud explosion.  It felt as though the streetcar was knocked off the rail.  I jumped out and ran about amidst the darkness and frightening roar.  I saw some younger female students surround a soldier to ask for help.  Their skin was burned and dangling from the tips of their fingers.  But the soldier himself was burned badly, and there was nothing he could do to help.  He was trying his best to comfort them with kind words.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter the darkness lifted I saw a living hell.  People were half naked due to their clothes burning off their body.  They had horrible burns and everywhere you looked, there was mass confusion.  I walked over the rubble, following a flow of people and dodging fires here and there.  I was crossing the river to flee the spreading flames and sparks when I heard a little voice say “Stupid Americans, hateful Americans.”  I turned around to find a young girl about 9 years of age carrying a baby on her back and following me.  “Where is your Mommy?”  I asked her.  “Mommy and Granny were crushed under the house and they told me to take the baby to my auntie’s in Itsukaichi”, she answered.  We crossed the river together.  Then we parted ways. She headed towards Itsukaichi and I headed towards Koi.  I felt concerned for her as she walked away.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I arrived at Koi, black rain started to fall.  I came by a farm and joined a group of people in a barn, who were waiting for the rain to stop.  I was soaked and wrapped my shivering body in a grass mat.  Then I became nauseated but thought that if I passed out here I would never make it home.  So I gathered all my might to hike over the mountain to Nagatsuka where a farmhouse had been arranged to be a refuge site for my family.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was walking by the riverbank in Nagatsuka when I noticed a strange phenomenon.  The houses that used to have grass roofs had become structures with only beams and pillars with furniture inside.  I walked under the burning sky in my tattered monpe pants.  “Mother!”  I called out at the farmhouse.  “Hisako’s home!  We were just about to leave to look for you,” my mother answered.  She was preparing some balls of rice and barley to bring along on her search for me.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI laid down on the tatami, cradled in my mother and sister’s arms.  My mother brought to my bedside some rice balls and tea, but I wasn’t able to swallow the food.  At night I looked beyond the bamboo forest and watched the city of Hiroshima burn.  I could see the bright red flames and feel the hot breeze that carried the stench of human bodies burning.  I didn’t sleep a wink.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“My daughter never returned,” said Mrs. Kushiyama, my classmate’s mother.  We all cried together.  In the evening a young woman with severe burns arrived at the farmhouse next door and asked if she could rest in their barn for a while.  She begged for water, but we were taught not to give burn victims water.  So we sliced some cucumbers to put on her burns.  My mother busily came and went between our house and the barn next door.  The young women passed away the following morning in spite of the efforts and care given by the villagers.  I grew very concerned about my health in the days that followed as I had nausea, diarrhea and loss of appetite.  My hair was falling out as well.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOnce the fires subsided in Hiroshima, my sister and I went to check on the state of our house in Higashi Hiratsuka.  The city was permeated with the stench of burned bodies and the rivers were filled with the dead.  Near Aioi Bridge, I passed by a group of eight dead schoolboys who had been burned while they held one another’s hands tightly as they lay in a circle.  I imagined they must have called out each other’s names, as they were burned alive.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe Kamiya-cho and Hatchobori areas were just as hellish.  I saw many people who were burned brown and swollen, and dead horses on their sides.  I passed by a mother, sitting on the stone steps of the bank, who was nursing her baby.  She was completely naked and bleeding from every part of her body and yet there was something so very noble about her that I couldn’t even speak to her.  I vowed to myself that I would speak to her on the way back, but when I returned she was nowhere to be found.  We carried on, walking over bodies, only to arrive at our home. It had been completely burned down.  “Your home burned in a pillar of flames.  The elderly next door saw the fire approaching and just retreated into their home, never to come out,” said a teary eyed neighbor who found us standing there.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe were passing through Kamiya-cho on our way back when a man came by and yelled “They’re stoning an American tied up to a telephone pole by Aioi Bridge.  You should go and see!”  We went in a hurry but saw neither an American nor people with stones.  I’m glad we didn’t run into an American that day.  I wonder now, had I come upon such a scene, if I would have joined the crowd to cast stones, or if I would have tried to stop the angry mass.  I cry every time I reflect upon this.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWar is such a cruel thing.  They say that 200,000 people lost their lives from the single blast of the atomic bomb.  As a survivor I want to tell the whole world that there are no winners in a nuclear war.  Destruction of humanity is the only result.  There can be no future for us under the threat of nuclear weapons.  I recognize the importance of the abolishment of nuclear weapons in these uncertain times.  I sincerely pray for world peace.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe Atomic Bomb Dome with its thorn crown stands as a grave on this anniversary</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 77 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I was working at the Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda) in Mukainada as a member of the Wartime Student Mobilization Workforce.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn Sunday, I had just had a lovely time with my sister and her friend, who had invited a couple of Thai exchange students to have tea and play music.  Back then it was impolite to play the piano at home, but we felt that we could bend the rules on weekends.  So we played Japanese songs on the piano, and the exchange students played the violin.  This was a special occasion and I couldn’t wait to tell my friends at the factory about the fun I had on my day off.  I left early the following morning, and arrived at Itsukaichi Station.  A lazy person,I ordinarily took a later train, but I was so excited I’d arrived earlier than usual.  Off to the factory I went.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn Mukainada, the students would line up in two rows and march to the cadence of “Head right!” and pass through the front gate. Our work clothes were grubby from the oil stains but we </p><p class=\"body_en\">\ndidn’t mind.  We had gotten used to it.  We started the day in the student waiting room.  There were some humble, long wooden tables with benches in the large waiting room of the sheds, which served as a place for the students to change clothes and eat and rest.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat day, I sat down and fidgeted with excitement, wondering how to begin to tell the story of my delightful Sunday.  That is when someone said, “It’s a B-29,” and pointed to the sky outside the window.  I followed the student’s outstretched finger and saw a B-29 plane drawing a beautiful bow of clouds in the clear blue sky.  We watched the plane in bewilderment.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat’s when something black and round was dropped from the plane.  I wondered what it was.  It gave off a blinding flash.  Someone said it was a flare bomb.  All I remember is that I was about to open my mouth to say, “There’s no way it can be a flare bomb, it’s so bright!”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI felt like I was floating in space, as if I were swimming, headed somewhere.  I was alone. There was nobody in sight.  I wondered what had happened.  I wondered where I was as I floated along.  Then I heard some noise in the distance.  It was approaching and getting louder.  I realized it was a human voice calling. This was when I came to.  I had lost consciousness.  I was surrounded in darkness and couldn’t see anything.  It took me some time to comprehend what had happened but gradually I started to make out my surroundings and found myself lying on the floor.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe waiting room was covered with broken window glass, desks and chairs.  I realized that I had been blown quite a way from where I had been sitting.  We all called out for our friends and started to gather outside.  By the time I got outside, most of the students were in the yard.  There were some who had cuts on their faces from the broken glass, and we checked each other for injuries.  There was a somber mood that hung in the air.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe teacher told us that Hiroshima was under attack and we should go into town to rescue people, but soon news came that the disaster was beyond the students’ capacity to help, and so we were ordered us to go home.  Since all of the public transportation systems were down, officials grouped the students by neighborhood so that we could walk home together.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI wondered what had happened.  I looked towards the city of Hiroshima, and saw a large white mushroom cloud rising higher and higher, getting bigger and bigger.  I questioned what could have caused such a cloud.  I speculated that perhaps a bomb was dropped into an armory, which caused a huge explosion.  I think there were about 25 of us who were returning to the Koi area.  Our teacher, Ms. Nobue Kanzaki, was leading our group.  Our first plan was to head to Hiroshima Station.  As we left the factory we saw people coming from Hiroshima evacuating towards Kure.  The horror of this sight stopped me in my tracks.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was a line of people dragging their charred bodies, who had been burned head to toe.  Their skin hung down like tattered cloth and swayed as they staggered step by step.  I had never seen such a sight and my legs trembled.  Someone said, “Let’s get it together, we’ve got to make it home,” and from that time on, I joined the queue and tried to encourage other students. I had to be strong, I was going home.  From the factory to Hiroshima Station, we walked against the flow of people, who were escaping towards Kure.  As we passed by Hiroshima Station, we joined in with a wave of refugees going towards Mt.Ushita.  We passed by people who lay by the river, moaning and groaning for water, but we couldn’t help them.  We walked by in silence, and I apologized to them in my mind. I kept walking as I listened to the voice of my remorseful heart.  It was a quiet march through hell.  Occasionally a student would stray from the group, as they collapsed.  I lost all ability to think or feel and became like an object that had no purpose but to keep walking.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNear Hiroshima Station, I saw a truck parked with many injured people on it.  People stood on the bed of the truck with their lifeless eyes gazing into the distance. Their faces were black and blue and shockingly, their hair stood straight out.  I realized that when humans face such a dreadful fright their hair stands up that way.  I shuddered at the sight of these burned people who had no choice but to go with the flow of others.  War is such a cruel and brutal thing.  I wondered what would happen to us.  But first I must just get home.  All I could do was to keep walking.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe took a break by the river in Ushita.  Ms. Nobue Kanzaki took out a large tomato from her backpack.  Over the weekend, Ms. Kanzaki had gone to her friend’s place in the countryside to buy some food.  “I have some tomatoes and potatoes but we can’t eat the potatoes raw,” she said.   “I only have two tomatoes but they’re big enough to share.”  I think we shared one tomato among 12 or 13 people.  It was the most delicious small slice of tomato that I ever had.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe stopped by one of the students’ homes near Yokogawa.  The house was partially collapsed, and the family had left a note written with charcoal on the tin sheet in front of the house.  The letter said that her family was safe and that she should come and meet them at a certain evacuation site.  Ms. Kanzaki encouraged the student to find her family at the evacuation site by following the train tracks.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt Koi Station the Neighborhood Ladies Club gave us tea and dry bread.  They greeted us kindly, welcoming us home, soothing our pains.  I breathed a sigh of relief for finally finding a safe little harbor.  There were some homes that were destroyed in Koi, but thankfully this area didn’t catch on fire.  It was dark by the time we arrived and I felt it would be impossible to carry on to Itsukaichi that day so I stayed over at a friend’s place.  Although my friend’s house was still standing, the glass was broken and scattered everywhere, the shelves were overturned, and the rooms were covered in debris. My friend’s mother was waiting up for her daughter’s return. When she saw us, she cleared out a space for us to sleep and insisted we stay overnight since it would be impossible to walk to Itsukaichi.  I don’t remember clearly but I think there were 4 or 5 of us.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSince all the doors and windows were broken we cleaned up the broken glass and hung a mosquito net.  We sat in our little mosquito-net tent and ate some dry bread.  The electricity was out, and I laid down in the darkness.  I watched a fire burning far in the distance: a red glow in the deep, vast darkness.  The city of Hiroshima was burned to the ground.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“That’s the Hijiyama area, isn’t it?” said one of my friends.  “I can’t believe we can see all the way to Hijiyama from here,” said another.  Everything was destroyed and burned down, except for a few black metal beams of larger structures sticking out of the rubble.  I just wanted to get home.  I wondered what had become of my family in Itsukaichi.  I wondered if my father, who worked in Hiroshima, was safe.  I wondered if my brother, who was also part of the student mobilization workforce, was alive.  It was a sleepless night, as I thought of various fearful things..</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI awoke around 5 a.m. the next morning and headed for Itsukaichi.  I left with two others, without changing any clothes, with our faces unwashed.  As we walked, we nibbled on the dried bread that was given to us.  I don’t even remember what I wore on my feet.  It was summer time and back then all we wore in the summer were the rationed flip-flops, but I have no recollection of whether I was wearing them or not.  I imagine it would have been quite hot, being that it was in the middle of summer, but I don’t even remember the heat. All I wanted was to get home and see my family.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI believe I arrived at Itsukaichi around 9 o’clock.  The whole town was waiting for their family members to return from Hiroshima.  When I approached my immediate neighborhood, someone recognized me and called out, “It’s Reiko from the Kajitani family.” They ran to my house with the news that I was back.  All of a sudden tears gushed to my eyes and I followed my neighbor.  All the sorrow and tears that I had pushed aside hit me like a wave that I did not know how to stop.  The people in my neighborhood greeted me with joy, as I wailed and ran through the street.  My father, who had heard the news, was waiting for me at the front door and caught me in his arms.  And then my mother came over.  The three of us hugged and cried.  My mother made me a hot bath and I cleaned my body, which was covered in black soot.  Then the relief I felt pulled me into a deep sleep.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI awoke after a couple of hours and went to help at a nearby temple, where they were arranging a cookout for the refugees from Hiroshima.  We cooked rice in a huge pot and made rice balls.  Then we took the rice balls on a bicycle cart to take them to the town hall, where the refugees were waiting to be assigned some resting space.  There were many burn victims leaning against the wall and lying about in the front rooms of the town hall.  Flies buzzed around people’s open wounds, laying maggots in them.  The burn victims were so lifeless that they didn’t even shoo the flies away.  When I tried to pick the larva out that was oozing in their wounds, they must have felt the pain, because their faces would twitch, and they closed their eyes tight and braced their body. They simply looked at the rice balls that we brought, not having enough energy to eat.  These people were rotting away.  Their bodies were being eaten alive by the larva.  There was nothing I could do to help them.  I felt like I was crawling around in hell.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOnce I got home there were some refugees in my home. It was a scene I’ll never forget.  Our small house was crowded with three people in the entry hall, and two in the family room.  The three people who lived in our entry hall were a shoemaker, his wife, and their young daughter of about 4 or 5.  Her body was covered in burns.  I don’t remember her real name, so I’ll call her Michiko.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen her father carried her in on his back Michiko cried, “It hurts, it hurts”.  My mother brought out a blanket so that she could lie down.  Even after lying down, Michiko kept crying with a weak voice and protesting about her pain.  My mother found an old summer kimono and boiled it to sterilize it and then tore it into strips to make bandages.  We only had one small tincture of medicine for burns, and it was not enough to properly cover her burns.  We gently wrapped Michiko in the bandages, but since she had burned her face as well she just looked like a bundle of bandage when we were finished.  Every day Michiko cried in pain until she exhausted herself and fell asleep.  We couldn’t find a doctor or medicine and all we could do was to take a fan and make a cooling breeze.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOne day something happened that is etched into my memory even to this day. Michiko’s voice was gradually losing its power.  My parents were away and I was reading a book by her side, when suddenly she started speaking in her sleep.  Her voice was clear and powerful.  “Mommy, the flowers are so beautiful.  There are butterflies, too.  See, over there!  Can you catch one for me?  Oh, there’s another one… hurry, hurry, over here!”  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nStartled, I put the book down and looked at Michiko’s face.  She was sleeping peacefully and dreaming of a beautiful field full of flowers.  She dwelled in this dreamful state for a while, until her voice trailed off.  I felt a sense of urgency and called for help, but it was too late.  Michiko had passed away peacefully.  Finally, she had been freed of the pain and suffering.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAnd then there was the time, during their evacuation, that the shoemaker’s family found a broken cart that had carried Michiko and 3 cans of food. They picked up the cans as they passed by the food factory.  These were large cans, about 20 centimeters in diameter, designed to feed the army.  When they arrived at our home they offered us 2 of these cans for our family to eat.  My mother protested, saying that it was too precious a gift, and surely the shoemaker’s family would need all 3 cans in the long run.  The cans were brand new.  The shoemaker insisted over and over that we should accept the gift as a token of appreciation for taking care of them. Finally my family gave in and decided we would all share the canned food.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe were quite excited to have food from a can since we were very hungry and tired of meal replacement foods.  What a treat!  My brother found an old can opener and we anxiously waited to see the meal inside as he opened the lid.  We were shocked to find that the content, which should have been cooked burdock root, was burned completely into black soot.  All three cans, with their shiny perfect exterior, contained only charred black burdock root.  For a while everyone fell into such a pit of disappointment.  That no one could utter a word.  But then laughter pierced the silence and we all laughed until our eyes watered.  We imagined the effort it took to carry 3 large cans along with an injured girl in a bicycle cart, all the way from Hiroshima to Itsukaichi.  We didn’t know what to do with the sadness we felt for the shoemaker and the humor that we found in the situation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe shoemaker and our family cremated Michiko.  After much effort my mother collected enough firewood and stacked it on a hand cart.  We laid Michiko’s body, which was wrapped in cotton, over the firewood and decorated it with some wild flowers and walked in a funeral line.  After the cremation, the shoemaker’s family gathered Michiko’s bones and left to stay with their relatives.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOne of the refugees, who was staying in our family room, developed a high fever and became bedridden.  There were spots on his skin and he vomited blood.  The town doctor said, “I’m not sure what illness this is but I believe it’s contagious.  The young ones are at risk, so you should keep this patient in quarantine.  The grade school is being used as an isolation ward.  Take him there immediately.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSo my mother once again went to borrow a hand cart and put a board on top of it so that the patient could lie down as she wheeled him over to the grade school.  Once the patient was taken away we sterilized the family rooms’ tatami flooring by rubbing it down with cresol. We also disinfected our hands. In hindsight I realize that his illness was not some epidemic but the effect of radiation exposure.  But at that time we were ignorant of the type of bomb that was dropped and nobody had even heard of an atomic bomb or radiation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe war ended on August 15, but the living situation was still severe.  There was a serious food shortage and we usually ate steamed or grilled balls made of potato powder, and gruel of rice cooked with lots of water.  My mother put monpe pants, her large sack on her back, and traveled to the farmhouses to acquire food. One by one our valuable kimonos vanished from our closet and turned into rice and potatoes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn September 30 we advanced one year and graduated from the school of Home Economics.  We gathered at Mt.Ushita and had our graduation ceremony outdoors.  If you look at my diploma, you’ll see that under the writing “School of Home Economics” is a small piece of paper covering up the words “School of English.”  The teachers must have tried hard to put together whatever they could in order to give us a graduation ceremony.  This was the first day I had gone to Hiroshima since the bomb.  Although it had been over a month since the bombing, the city was still a burnt field and I could see the steel structure of the Fukuya Department Store all the way from Koi Station.  I saw people building humble huts near Hiroshima Station and doing their best to survive.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI would like to tell you a story about Ms. T, my classmate.  One day I went to the grand reopening of the Fukuya Department Store.  Seeing Fukuya reopened after such devastation gave me strength.  I believe it was just a single-story building but the store was filled with merchandise and people.  That’s where I ran into Ms. T.  She had a scarf over her head and I could see the scars on her face, left by broken glass.  She called my name and, at first sight, I barely recognized her.  She told me of her experience on August 6.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMs. T lived in a court-provided residence with her father, who worked in the courthouse.  Her mother and sisters were evacuated in the countryside.  At 8:15 a.m. on August 6, her father was standing by the front door just about to leave for work and she was in the family room. That was when the sudden force of an explosion knocked her unconscious and buried her under the house.  When she came to, she heard her father calling her and she tried to answer, “Father, I am here.”  But there was a large beam that weighed on her chest and she couldn’t yell.  Struggling, she freed her upper body enough to find a scrap of wood and started banging on the beam to alert her father of her location.  Her father was not trapped since he had been standing at the front door.  Ms. T could tell that her father was moving around the rubble and listening to her banging, but still it took him a very long time to find her.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThen she smelled smoke and realized that the house was about to catch fire.  She called out, “Father, you are able to escape, so please run away.”  “I’m fine.  I’m ready to die here.  Just please save yourself.”  Her father didn’t listen to her and kept moving the rubble about and then she heard some water running. She heard her father say, “T, I’m sorry, I can’t help you. Please forgive me.  I’m running some precious water for you and I hope it will give you some relief.”  Ms. T closed her eyes and cried as she heard her father’s agonizing parting words.  But then she heard more noise of rubble being moved around and somehow the beam that had pinned her down was lifted.  She broke free and realized that her father, having given up and left, had had second thoughts and turned around to come and rescue her.  They soaked their bodies in water and ran through the fire and escaped.  Ms. T told me, “My father saved my life and I would jump into fire for him.  If it wasn’t for him, I would have been burned alive.  I am so grateful.”  I thought about all the people who were burned alive while they lay trapped under their homes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhenever I see the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima on TV, projected against the other clouds, I see all the people who were burned alive.  The world does not need atomic bombs and nuclear weapons.  The single bomb dropped by Enola Gay burned tens of thousands of people and destroyed many humans, animals, plants, and nature with its radiation.  Thinking again of the people who suffer from the aftereffects of radiation and the pain that is passed down the generations strengthens my conviction that we cannot allow the use of nuclear weapons.  We must abolish them from the world. If we do not, our precious earth will be polluted and destroyed by these weapons.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMs. T and her father moved to Beppu for rest and recovery and her father soon passed away.  Ms. T passed away a few years ago.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSixty years have passed since then.  In December of 1945 I had a high fever and was bedridden by an illness for which there was no diagnosis.  For a period of time I felt that I couldn’t stand the cruelty of war, the ugly nature of humankind, and simply wanted to quit being a human myself.  But every time I thought of killing myself, I was reminded of how my parents greeted me with tears of joy that day when I returned from Hiroshima, and I found the courage to live for them.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’m glad that I chose life.  In the past 60 years I have encountered so much love and kindness.  Although it was a rough ride, I have many fond memories and I learned about the wonderful nature of life.  Had I chosen death back then, I would have ended my life as a hateful, pathetic person.  I believe peace will come when we all cultivate understanding and communication, people to people, nation to nation.  I believe we will achieve peace when every person on earth makes the effort to abolish war.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI would like to close with some poems from my diaries.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n?\tMushroom Cloud (written in 1984)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs if bubbling out of the ground</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe mushroom cloud grows</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHigh, high above, larger and larger</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nUnderneath, tens of thousands</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAre stripped naked of their flesh</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBurned, die screaming</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFellow humans, please do not forget.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n?\tBlack Rain</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBlack rain covers half of Father’s face</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nRemains black, in the urn\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n?\tGive me water (written in 1983)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Water, give me water”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI walked by without giving them a hand.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI cursed my cruel heart</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAnd followed the row of people</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThey extended their hands, burned black,</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAnd called for help</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBut I pretended not to see them</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAnd passed by with the heart of a devi\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter 36 years</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI still hear them call</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Water, give me water”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n?

I was in the 2nd year at Hiroshima Jogakuin College of Health and part of the student mobilization workforce.  As soon as I entered the factory, I heard a huge explosive sound, and I was slammed down to the floor with my breath knocked out.  Part of the ceiling fell and glass shattered and flew everywhere. Some of my friends who were cut by the glass were crying.  We went outside in a daze and saw a mushroom cloud hovering tall in the sky.  We speculated that a bomb must have been dropped on an armory, which caused the huge explosion.  Soon the students of Hiroshima Jogakuin were led by our teacher, Mr. Hisashi Harada, to evacuate towards a bomb shelter in the mountains.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tA few hours later, it was decided that we could return to the factory.  When we approached the street in front of the factory, we all gasped at the strange and terrifying sight.  Injured people, whose clothes hung in rags from their bodies, were clamoring over each other to get into the gate of the factory.  I saw a mother, with a red sash wrapped around her hips, firmly gripping her baby sideways with her left arm. Her hair was in a mess and her upper body was naked.  She looked like a women who had lost her wits. This image is burned into the back of my mind, even after 60 years.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe entered the factory in a hurry, and helped the factory workers lay the refugees down on mats on the ground. The room filled up quickly with people. Their clothes and skin were charred and peeling off.  There was a little boy whose face and lips were swollen black and blue. He cried out, “Who did this to me!”  All of them were asking for water, but the man who appeared to be the factory doctor yelled over the voices “Don’t give them water!”  It was like watching hell itself.  I didn’t know how to care for the injured, and all I could do was soak some gauze in the water from my canteen and wet the mouths of those who asked for water.  I spread oil over their burns.  As the hours passed and we gathered more information on the devastation of Hiroshima, the students worried about their families and cried. By and by, the students formed groups by neighborhoods and left for Hiroshima.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tI lived in a company residence in the hillside of Mukainada.  Part of the roof and windows were blown off the house.  My father had stayed home because he had injured his leg while helping with the building demolition in Hiroshima the day before.  My mother and two little brothers were fine.  I was relieved that my whole family was alive, including my father, who escaped the bomb by pure luck. But I also felt guilty when I thought of all my friends who lost their family members.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tThe next day, August 7, the neighborhood council organized a rescue team to go into Hiroshima. They were short on volunteers, and since my father was injured, I was chosen to volunteer as a representative of our family.  There were only a few of us and I was the only female.  We carried grass mats, water, rice balls, and bandages in a truck and headed for the city.  I gasped as we approached the city.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tIt was a burned field as far as the eye could see.  There was nothing to block our view of the mountain range on the other side of the delta.  There was an awful smell.  As we drove on a road-less path, I saw the rivers filled with dead bodies.  Along the rivers were the bodies of those who came in search of water but who had lost their lives before they reached the banks.  The men in my group gathered these bodies in one area and I covered each body with a grass mat.  There were no survivors in the area.  We drove around aimlessly.  The stench was making me nauseous.  In the evening we decided we should head home, since we had run out of grass mats and there was nobody alive to administer first aid to.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tThis was no natural disaster.  Hundreds of thousands of innocent people vanished from this earth without a chance to say goodbye to their loved ones, their dreams and hopes and even their right to protest, stolen. There are innumerable people who suffered from the aftereffects of radiation.  We Japanese are privileged to live in peaceful times, but we cannot forget the hundreds of thousands of atomic bomb victims.  I reflect on their suffering and I pray for a world without nuclear weapons, a world of peace.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 79 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I was working in a branch depot for the army as a representative of the Hiroshima Jogakuin High School Volunteer Service Corps.  For safety reasons, the administration had been moved to a wing in Kaitaichi High School for Women as the war had worsened.  The atomic bomb was dropped when I had just arrived on foot from the Kaitaichi Station.  I heard a terrible roar.  Startled, I ran up the small hill behind the school building.  I looked over towards Hiroshima and saw a mushroom cloud in the sky.  The smoke was rising as if it were boiling out of the ground, splitting to either side and then pouring down.  What could have become of my parents who were at home in the city?  My brother, who was in Nichu Middle School and took part in the student mobilization workforce, was supposed to have been helping with the building demolition in the city.  My heart sank with fear.  But we were not allowed to go into the city to look for our loved ones.  The whole city was burning, creating a hellish scene of people fleeing, collapsing, jumping into the rivers, and dying.  That evening I slept at my workplace.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The next morning, on the 7, the military arranged for a truck to take those who lived in Hiroshima back into the city, and drop people off where they wished. I got off at Matoba-cho and  \nwent to the streetcar railroads by Hijiyama.  The streetcar lines were hanging from the posts, and I lost my breath at the sight of several streetcars scorched black.  I saw some people who wandered about in a daze, with their torn clothes hanging from their bodies, their faces black and their eyes puffed up.  I passed by a warehouse in the Army Provisions depot (factory for military food cans) that was still in flames.  There were many people sitting on the street in front of Hijiyama Shrine.  They asked the passersby for water, but the people walking didn’t know where to get water, and they were too preoccupied with finding their own families.  They simply shuffled past the thirsty in a hurry.  I finally arrived at my street and found a pile of rubble where my house used to be.  I stood in a stupor for a while, until my brother came back and found me.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">We found in the debris a piece of plank with faint writing, “We’re going to the shelter in Mt.Hiji.”  My brother and I hiked by Tamonin Temple and saw white smoke rising in the lower valley, where they were burning a pile of bodies.  We went from one shelter-cave to another, calling our parents’ names as we peeked inside.  When we came by a cave under a hanging bridge, we heard our father call out, “We’re here.”  We held each other’s hands and rejoiced.  My father, who had been watering the plants in the yard, suffered from terrible burns to his upper body.  His arm was especially bad and you could see down to his bone. He collapsed from the flash, and when he regained consciousness he was in front of the Hijiyama Shrine.  He had been thrown at least 100 meters.  I shivered at the thought of such a powerful blast.  My mother was trapped under the house.  My father returned back to the house and dug through the rubble.  The only way  \nto find her was to listen and follow her cry for help.  First, he saw her big toe, and then like a madman he lifted all the rubble off to save her.  Although he was able to rescue her out of the wreckage, she had lots of glass stuck in her body, and it was difficult for her to move.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I felt it was crucial for us to find safety and remembered that Lieutenant H. said to bring the injured and those whose houses had burned born, to Kaitaichi Middle School for women.  My brother and I decided that we should go to the old headquarters in Yano to see if someone could arrange for a truck to take my parents.  Once we got to the freeway, we saw many people heading east, dragging their tattered clothes and injured bodies.  Luckily, when we arrived at the headquarters, they told us that there would be a military truck making rounds in the city and that they would pick us up under the hanging bridge in the evening.  We returned to the cave-shelter with relief.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I believe there were a little less than 20 people who found refuge in the cave.  Among them was a young mother whose baby was missing, and a student of Joshisho Middle School for Women.  The mother, who couldn’t have been that much older than I, uttered deliriously “My breasts hurt, my breasts are in pain” all night long.  Her breasts were swelling because she had no baby to drink her milk.  The student of Joshisho Middle School for women lay on her side, not able to murmur a word.  Most of the people in the cave kept quiet.  I fell asleep, exhausted from the day.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The next morning, on the 8, there was a hush of silence when I awoke.  I realized that both the young mother and the student had passed away in the night and had been taken away.  I wondered where they had been taken.  I thought about the sad, dark scene in the cave last night, and misery and loneliness pierced my heart.  I couldn’t speak.  Looking back, I am terribly sorry that I hadn’t asked for their names.  Although I couldn’t have helped them then, once things got settled I probably could have somehow found their families and told them of their last night on earth.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">It was the third day since the bombing.  Our family and a few other refugees took shelter in the sewing room of Kaitaichi Middle School for women.  That is when I heard that one of my classmates and co-workers, Miss N., was at the old government office building in Yano after the army discovered her collapsed in front of Hijiyama Shrine.  I had been concerned for her safety since I knew that she had some business in the city the morning of the 6th and was scheduled to take a later train out to work.  A messenger told me that Miss N. was asking to see me. \nI rushed to her side.  She lay alone on the tatami mats in a small room that was previously used for night duty.  She didn’t seem to be injured badly, but the skin on her forehead was peeled off and she also had a hole about the size of a quarter on the inside of her wrist.  It didn’t seem like anyone had tended to her injuries.  She was in pain but also had to go to the bathroom.  I told her to sit tight while I went to find a basin, but she insisted that she could take care of herself and crawled across the tatami mat.  I don’t remember how long I stayed there or what we talked about.  But I do remember that she had her wits about her until the end, and that she told me that I could have the basket that she kept in her locker.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The next day, on the 9, I doubted my ears when I heard that Miss N. had passed away.  My head swirled with thoughts of disbelief as I recalled how clear-minded she was, and how she was able to move even if it was to drag herself to the bathroom.  How could she pass away so June?  I rushed over to the government office building in Yano, only to be told by my boss that they were going to cremate some bodies there and I was not allowed to stay.  Later I was told that when the flame engulfed Miss N’s body, her hands, which were folded in prayer over her chest, came undone and extended up into the sky. Was there something that she was trying to say?  At least, she was being cremated by those with goodwill.  I feel a squeezing sensation in my chest whenever I think about the misery of her last moments. She was only 18.  \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">A few days later Ms. N’s brother came from the Naval Academy in Etajima Island to retrieve her bones.  He visited Lieutenant H. and I brought Ms. N’s basket that had been entrusted to me.  Inside we found a few stuffed dolls (it was popular among female students to collect them), and a photograph of her and me, along with two other girlfriends, taken at a photographer’s on New Year’s Day. in 1944.  I felt it was best to give the basket and its contents to Miss N’s brother.  I asked him to accept the items.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">In the three days between the 7th and the 9th, I witnessed three deaths of people of my generation.  As a survivor, I feel a responsibility to record these cruel and lonely deaths so that we may remember that such brutality shall never be repeated.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Lastly, I would like to dedicate a sincere prayer to those who lost their lives in the atomic bomb.  May they all rest in peace. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\n… 79 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

From Kotachi Station near my home, we got on the train to Hiroshima Station. It was just like a ghost town that was reduced to rubble by the A-bomb explosion. To this day, I can see that ghost town when I close my eyes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI said, “Jogakuin might be this way,” and while walking, I saw Sakae Bridge which I used to walk over. “Oh! You are still here. Good for you!” I said to the bridge. We walked over the half-damaged bridge toward the campus. The high brick fence around the Campus was all broken down to pieces. The dormitory where I had lived for five years was in that corner and on the east corner, there used to be the missionary residence. After missionaries left Japan the school president’s family lived there. Between the dormitory and residence was a two-storied School Building. On the other side of the playground, there used to be the elementary school, the kindergarten, that beautiful chapel, etc. Now they were completely gone. In the ruins, I vividly remember seeing one person, whose sex I couldn’t tell, wearing black clothes, trying to search for something with a pair of tongs around a big broken burned safe.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThinking if we head for Mt.Ushita where we used to go for farming, I might see someone belonging to our School, we walked on, but we met no one on the way. Finally we got to the school hut, where farming tools were kept. There I finally met a lady working for our school office, I felt so relieved that I gave her all the rice balls Mother had made. She said that the teachers were out looking for the missing students around the suburbs.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEven now I feel it strange that I left Hiroshima by the last train for home on the night before the A-bombing. Three months before our graduation from high school we got the order to go to the military factories to work. So I moved to the Armament Industory’s dorm with two of my dorm friends as student workers. It was arranged for me to go to work at the Labor Office. Then at the beginning of August, I saw the note announcing that those who wanted to move to the Shio-machi Branch Office could do so. I asked to be one of them so that I could commute from my home. Getting permission to work there from Aug. 8, I was so happy to be at home after five years of dorm life. I took the last train home after work on Aug. 5 saying to my friends who came to see me off, “This might be the last time to see Hiroshima.” The next day, Aug. 6, I got one day off and stayed in bed till late in the morning. Then around 8 o’clock, the house began to shake. Thinking there might be an earthquake, I jumped out of the house, but nothing had changed. I was, however, worried, thinking something might have happened near Hiroshima. No news came to me till the evening. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThen my uncle, who happened to be in Hiroshima City that morning to buy a bicycle, came back wearing a bloody torn shirt, and told us about the city. When he got to the store, with the huge sound of an explosion, he found himself under the rubble. Managing somehow to go out of the debris, he saw something like black rain coming down on him. He happened to see a bicycle there, which he borrowed, and came back. We were really shocked to hear his story. After a while, my uncle had a very high fever for three days, without eating anything except ice-cubes, and having big blue spots all over his body. Without saying anything he passed away. Taking care of his strange sickness for three days, I thanked him, thinking he died instead of me.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe day after the a-bombing, I commuted to my new office in Shio-machi by train. To my great surprise, I saw many A-bombed soldiers lying on the freighter wearing bloody torn uniforms with a lot of white tiny maggots moving around on them. I couldn’t tell whether they were alive or dead and being sent to the country hospitals or not. I couldn’t do anything for them except pray.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAnother unforgettable thing I experienced before the war ended was that three of us from Jogakuin High School Dorm who had been baptized a year before were surprised to get an order to appear at the Military Police Station one day in February. Anyway we were there one morning and guided into a bog room where more than 10 of our school graduates were already sitting. A first lieutenant said to us, “You are not here because you did something wrong. From now on you should each be in a private room and asked about your school, so you’d better answer the questions honestly.” Then in a small private room a military policeman said, “Since you are a Christian, I don’t think you will say anything wrong about your school, but you should answer whatever I ask from now, Jogakuin is teaching the American religion, Christianity, at school. We will not close your school but remove Christianity from your school in order to make your school a real Japanese one. The head teacher, Mr. Fumitake Mitsui, said that there is a similarity between the Japanese God and the Jewish one, isn’t that right? Didn’t the dorm inspector force you to be Christians? and so on. Till toward evening he kept asking me about school: “You belong to the spy group, so you will say nothing wrong about your school, but…” Saying so, he brought in a big file of the students’ testimony and read me one or two saying that he would come to me to get my seal. “Don’t tell anybody about today,” he said and made me stay there till dark.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAccording to the students remaining at school,“ Six Military men came to school on horses to find out something about spying in vain, but they were happy to find a small flag of England.” But the most saddest thing was that four of our Christian teachers had to leave our school.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSo before the A-bombing, our school had a terrible experience?we should never become a military nation again</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 79 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

It is surprising to me that I have lived so long.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn April of 1944 I started attending Jogakuin College.  At the end of the second semester, I was assigned to the Student Mobilization Workforce and began living in the dormitories of the munitions factory at Amagasaki.  Every day, I made parts for flight instruments in the assembly line.  I lived in constant fear of the rifle rakes during the frequent air raids.  I returned to Hiroshima in March of 1945 and was immediately summoned to Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda) in Mukainada. I was covered in oil every day as I made parts for guns on a lathe.  This is how I came to that unforgettable day.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt 8:15 a.m. on August 6 there was a bright red flash accompanied by a thunderous explosion that threw us against the walls of the factory.  The windows in the room were blown out and shattered.  I did not know what had happened.  Now as I look back, I realize this was the moment my friends and teachers, who were on campus in the city, lost their precious lives. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy walk home was a miserable and hellish one.  People whose faces were purple and swollen to twice their size; those whose skin was peeled off completely; injured folks in torn clothes, they all staggered towards the mountain for refuge.  Bodies lay everywhere, burned so black that I couldn’t tell whether they were male or female.  The rivers were stacked with people in search of the water flowing under the pile of bodies.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe next day my father and I walked around the city in search of my brother, who was working at the Army Clothing Depot (factory for military uniforms).  Men from the Citizen’s Defense Reserve were using a pickaxe to roll the bodies and gather them in a pile. The bodies looked like charred mannequins.  Flies buzzed around people’s infected injuries.  There were maggots growing in the wounds.  Some lay on the ground and occasionally with their last bit of energy begged, “Water! Wat…”  There were bodies of mothers burned to death sitting in a fire cistern while still clutching their young ones.  How can I forget such a dreadful sight?</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe must not allow the use of nuclear weapons.  I pray for the world to become a peaceful planet soon.  May the souls of the victims rest in peace.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 79 years old </p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I walked along for a while but then I heard a slight popping sound over my head. I covered my eyes and ears in a reflex and jumped into a nearby public building.  As soon as I squatted there was a loud bang outside.  I left the building shaking, thinking the structure would crumble.  People from the office in the building were saying “It’s an air raid; how awful! You’d better get home immediately”.  I headed home and as I ran, a person who was running in front of me looked back and said, “How lucky we are for taking this street.  The people walking on the wide road two blocks down are covered with burns and with blood.  There are some that were thrown down and died on the spot.  We are lucky and we should be strong.”  I gathered some strength from the stranger’s encouragement, but the journey home was long and dreadful.  People were wailing in their destroyed homes.  I was shaking by the time I made it to my house.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAlthough part of our home was damaged, my parents were safe and they welcomed me home.  My oldest sister also returned, but my second oldest sister did not and so we decided to search for her. We came to Koi Station and looked towards the city.  There wasn’t much left to look at.  People standing around the station spoke amongst themselves:  “You can see all the way to Hiroshima Station because there’s nothing to block the view.  This is a living hell.”  “I wonder when the trains will start running again.” </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe kept going to find my sister. When we approached the city center, I noticed there were many who seemed to have thin and shabby gray cloth hanging from their heads, chins, or fingertips.  I thought the cloth was from burned kimonos, but as I got a closer look I realized that this was burned skin peeling off their bodies.  My tears flowed and for a while I stood in a stupor, unable to move.  Words cannot express the way I felt.  I continued to search for my sister long after that day, but she never found her.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe days that followed were very sad indeed.  One day as I approached adulthood, I visited a doctor’s clinic as I hadn’t been feeling well.  The office ran some tests on my bone marrow and diagnosed me with leucopenia and anemia.  This was a common aftereffect from the radiation of the bomb, and the doctors told me that the best way to correct my condition was to increase the protein in my diet.  Since my childhood I had always had a big appetite, so this treatment suited me well.  But there were other treatments that required me to commute to the hospital, and I remember arranging my day’s work with difficulty.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFor many years I suffered from the aftereffects of radiation.  The saving grace was being able to teach at Jogakuin Junior High and High School.  Every day, the students attended classes and studied with such interest and passion that I felt inspired to focus on my lectures for as long as I lived.  I am deeply grateful for all the people who supported me, and I feel that I owe my life to them.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe city that was rumored to be unlivable for 75 years is now a peaceful and vibrant community.  But I believe it is important to never forget the suffering caused by the atomic bomb.  We must remember the victims’ pain as if it were part of our own bodies.  I pray for the 350 souls of the students and teachers at Jogakuin who lost their lives in the bombing.  And I hope for the young generation to continue spreading the message of world peace, so that such a tragedy will never be repeated.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 79 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I entered Hiroshima Jogakuin College of Economics before the war and was working at the administration office.  Fortunately I took a day off on August 6 and was at home in Jigozen Village, which saved me from becoming victim to the atomic bomb.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was in the kitchen sipping some tea when a flickering light shone into the house, followed by a powerful blast.  I rushed out of the house and saw a huge doughnut cloud in the sky.  A pillar of smoke, that rose from the ground reached the cloud and became the shape of a mushroom.  At night I looked across the inland sea and saw the whole city of Hiroshima burning.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nTruckloads of victims were brought to Jigozen Village, but by the time they arrived half of them were dead.  Everyone had terrible boils and their faces were burned.  One man told me that while he was cutting the weeds in the rice paddies, the water that he stood in bubbled up with the flash, and the uncovered parts of his body got burned.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nClasses resumed in September at the humble sheds in Ushita.  There were 17 students in the School of Economics.  For two years, until I graduated, I walked all the way to school from Hiroshima station, which took me about 50 minutes each way.  I remember seeing orphans of war living in the brick building of Hiroshima Station.  We had our graduation ceremony in a shed that also served as a chapel.  I remember some American soldiers giving us a ride back to the station in their jeep after the graduation ceremony.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI moved to Tokyo the following October to get married and haven’t returned since.  I get sentimental when I think of Hiroshima.  I remember many teachers (Principal Matsumoto, Vice Principal Isao Matsushita, Mr. Toru Ingu, Mr. Kokuson Nagakura, and Ms. Mary McMilan) and above all, I remember the story that the school principal Matsumoto once told me.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe Tale of Principal Takuo Matsumoto</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe were in chapel when the 3-story building collapsed on top of us.  The teachers who happened to be standing near the windows were able to escape, but I could not help the students who were screaming and were trapped inside the rubble.  Mr. Matsumoto’s wife and some other people were gathered at the riverside and were praying in a circle, when suddenly there was a tornado. The tornado scooped the members of the circle high up in the sky, right in front of Mr. Matsumoto’s eyes. They were never found again.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n…79 years old\n</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

That morning, as always, I took the Ujina Line streetcar to Hiroshima Station from my home in the city and transferred to a train on the Sanyo Line to Mukainada Station.  Then I walked to the Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda).  At the factory I made parts for guns and weapons.  I arrived at the factory at 8 o’clock and just as I was getting ready to work, there was the flash (Pika) and a blast (Don).  Instantly I ducked under the worktable.  All of the windows in the factory shattered into pieces and my friends, who were near the windows, got glass stuck in their faces.  After a little while, the teachers and factory managers instructed us to go outside.  We saw a large mushroom cloud rising over the city of Hiroshima.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tSoon, burn victims arrived in a truck and were put of the floor in the factory.  We were told to administer first aid, but there was no medicine.  People were begging for water but back then we were told that giving water to burn victims would aggravate their condition, so we couldn’t ease their thirst.  All we could do was soak cloths in mechanic’s grease and apply it to the burned flesh.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tIn the afternoon we were told to return to our homes, and I went to Mukainada Station, only to find that the trains weren’t running.  I walked with my friends to Hiroshima Station.  I don’t remember how many hours it took, but the sky was still light.  The whole city was completely burned down.  I walked to my house, which was near the Army Ordnance Supply Depot (factory for military weapons) on the east side of Mt. Hiji.  The house managed to survive the fire, but the blast had shattered the windows, overturned the tatami mats, and had knocked over the furniture.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tI realized my mother was gone.  She went to search for my brother who was working at the building demolition site in Zakoba-cho.  While she was gone, a young boy came into the house.  He was covered in burns from head to toe.  I didn’t recognize that he was my brother until he said his name.  After the blast, some soldiers had picked him up, along with those at the work site who were still alive.  He was taken to an armory and put down on the floor to rest, but he received no medical care or help.  Soon he realized how close he was to home, so he walked back.  My mother eventually returned home.  She couldn’t get past the west side of Mt. Hiji because it was on fire.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tMy brother passed away the following morning.

The campus was located in Kaminobori-cho where the Jogakuin High School now stands.  I think I had started school about a week prior to that fateful day.  There was an air raid warning in the morning so I was delayed in leaving my home.  I went to school with my friend Ms. Kuwabara and took a seat in the back of the Assembly Hall to attend morning chapel.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">After chapel, I remember seeing the clock in the hallway.  It pointed to 8:15.  At that moment, a strong flash went off and I clung to Ms. Kuwabara. I don’t remember much about what happened in the confusion immediately afterwards.  I do remember, however, that was the last time I saw Ms. Kuwabara.  When I realized I was under the collapsed building and I was trapped, I think I instinctively started doing the “cover your eyes and ears and open your mouth” exercise that we learned in the emergency drills.  Finally, when I managed to crawl out, I saw that a sea of fire surrounded me.  I don’t remember how I escaped.  My left hand and eyelid were cut and bleeding.  The blood got in my eye and I couldn’t see.  I ran into Ms. Numabe and she washed my face with water from a pump. I don’t remember how we parted.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">In desperation, I dodged the fire and reached Sentei Garden (Shukkeien).  I met up with Ms. Takeko Shimazu, who was a language teacher, and headed towards the Enko River.  The flames licked both banks of the river, and Ms. Shimazu and I crouched into a tight ball, shaking and holding each other.  I also don’t remember how I parted from her. Her whereabouts were unclear for a while.  The river was filled with injured people moaning and groaning.  Dead bodies floated alongside debris, and it truly was hell on earth.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I think I sat there until early evening.  A First Aid boat full of dead bodies approached and took me (I can’t swim) across the river.  The sight from the boat was also hellish.  A woman from the 2nd floor of a house on fire screamed for help until the flame swallowed her and the whole house.  I saw many people whose skin had burned off and hung from their hands.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">When I got off the boat I heard my name being called.  I turned around but I didn’t recognize anybody.  I continued to walk and heard the small voice again. It belonged to a girl.  “It’s me, Hanamoto,” she squeezed out.  I looked at the face of this girl and realized that I didn’t recognize her because a chunk of flesh at the bridge of her nose was cut and dangling off.  She and I were neighborhood playmates.  Now her face was terribly disfigured.  Her wounds didn’t disgust me, as everywhere you looked you saw distorted and horrific injuries.  I took her to the First Aid Station at the eastern military training ground, and then I followed the Ujina train tracks towards my home in Oko. Fortunately, since I had been playing basketball back then, my high-top lace-up shoes didn’t come off in the explosion and I was able to walk over the sizzling rubble. \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">It was night by the time I arrived at my neighborhood.  I stopped by the Hanamotos to tell them how I had left their daughter at the First Aid Station.  I reached my house, which was more like a frame, with furniture and belongings tossed everywhere.  My sister and her husband were there, and my mother was lying on the floor nearby.  Nobody said a word to me.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">My family assumed I was dead since I was at school only 1 or 2 kilometers from the epicenter.  My brother-in-law walked around in search for me.  He checked the corpses of girls about my age.  He even pulled out dead bodies with their heads dunked in the fire cisterns to check to see if I was one of them.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">At that time, my older brothers and sisters were already living away from home, and I was the only one who remained living with my parents.  My father was at the Mitsubishi ship factory in Kanon when the bomb exploded.  My mother was working at a building demolition site in Tsurumi Brige, and the scorching heat left terrible burns on the backside of her body.  She was covered in burns from the back of her neck, down to her heels.  Thanks to my brother-in-law, who was in the military, a medical officer and a few officers from the sanitation department came to care for my mother.  It sounds disgusting but back then it was common to have maggots growing out of the wounds.  One way to prevent this was to get a blood transfusion, but there wasn’t enough blood.  The sanitation officers told us that on the battlegrounds during blood shortage, soldiers would receive horse blood transfusions.  They asked us if we were interested and we decided that we would try anything.  That was the only thing that could save my mother.  After the transfusion I heard that you could treat burns by administering ground-up human bones.  I went to Oko Grade School, where they had dug a hole in the school playground to make a crematorium.  I picked up some bones, crushed them into powder, and applied it to my mother’s back.  I was beyond being disturbed by anything.  When I was told that flowers were good for burns, I found flowers.  Every day I dedicated myself to caring for my mother.  I was experiencing diarrhea and losing my hair, but I wouldn’t allow myself to be bothered by that. My father wandered the streets of the city even though they were polluted with radiation and toxic gas. He passed away in August the year after.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">My mother was taken to a First Aid station in one of the barracks.  Shortly after, she was transported on an American military sleeping car to the Navy Hospital in Otake.  This was the first time that my mother saw the city in ruins.  She cried and sighed over and over as she lay on her stomach.  The miserable sight of my mother, who used to be so strong, will remain forever in my memory, as a symbol of defeat.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">My mother recovered and left the hospital after about a year.  She was healthy enough to be working in the fields, until one day about three years after the bombing she began to throw up everyday.  There were pink roundworms in her vomit.  She kept vomiting a mass of roundworms about the length of 10 to 15 centimeters into a basin.  Looking back, I’m wondering if the horse blood transfusion wasn’t at fault.  She continued to throw up, suffering until the end of her life in July 1950.  It still gives me the creeps to think about the roundworms that ate my mother alive  \nfrom the inside out.  But we did our best to save her life immediately after the bombing and for that, no one is to blame. It was thanks to the blood transfusion that my mother survived then.  My suffering was nothing compared to hers.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Although my parents died, thanks to the fact that I was in school at Jogakuin, I was given aid even after the war.  Ms. McMillan also gave me much joy.  Strangely, I did not feel resentment towards Americans regardless of the bombing.  There wasn’t much we could do about the anguish and misery that we experienced during the war.  There was much to be done just in order to survive.  Our hearts were hardened.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">At Jogakuin, we read the Bible and I felt the close presence of God.  Losing my parents at such a young age, I frequently visited my parents’ grave.  I can withstand anything now that I have lived through such painful events.  I believe the experiences after the bombing helped me become stronger as a human being.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Until now, I never spoke to others about my experiences of the atomic bomb.  It’s not that I couldn’t bear to reflect upon my memories.  I just didn’t want it to seem that I was lecturing the younger generation. I felt that if I spoke out, people would avoid me.  \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The year before last I heard from my classmate’s family in Yokohama.  My classmate was applying for A-Bomb Health Book and was looking for witnesses.  It was Ms. Numabe, the classmate who saved my life by washing my bloody face at the water pump and leading me to safety. Prompted by the testimonial I gave as a witness, gradually I have begun speaking of my experiences to others.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">It is hard to believe that it has been 60 years now.  I battled many illnesses.  Currently I have a tumor in my thyroid gland.  As I age, I worry that my health is compromised by the radiation from the atomic bomb.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The message I have for the young generation is to never create war.  Who wants to live in such a hateful state? During the war we were taught to hate Americans and sang despising songs on our way to the bomb shelters, without even knowing why.  Nothing good comes from war.  We humans are not enemies against each other.  We must get along with our neighbors and give thanks for our lives.  We must remember to be compassionate and live in harmony.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 77 years old</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n(Dictated to and recorded by Hiromi Morita)</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I left my house in the usual fashion, air raid hood in hand.  We, the students of Hiroshima Jogakuin switched from the Student Mobilization Workforce to the Women’s Volunteer Service Corps and were assigned at the Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda) to make guns.  I wasn’t feeling very well that morning, so I got a note of permission from our teacher Mr. Harada to go to the factory clinic.  My friends Ms. Watanabe and Ms. Kitamura (deceased), escorted me.  I looked up at the clock and saw that it was 8:14.  When we went outside we were surprised to see a B-29 Fighter Plane fly towards the city of Hiroshima.  It was hot, so we found some shade under a tree as we watched the silver plane.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat is when we saw a bright orange flash reflected on the glass of the factory windows.  Just as I said, “What’s that light?” there was a powerful blast and I fell to the ground under the tree.  My two friends led me to the bomb shelter nearby.  After the noise subsided we looked over at the factory and saw the roof caving in. The windows were completely broken.  We entered the factory to see what had happened.  The machinery was stopped, and I found Mr. Harada with a bleeding face.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI couldn’t comprehend what had happened.  At Mr. Harada’s prompt to “Look over there, towards the riverbanks,” I saw a mushroom cloud rising above Hiroshima.  We were stunned.  Burn victims started arriving at the factory.  Some were so disfigured that it was impossible to tell whether they were men or women.  I began to realize the severity of the situation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe air raid warning sirens went off and on several times that day.  The injured and burned kept increasing in number.  We used paintbrushes to put oil on their wounds.  I remember encountering many burn victims on my way home. They begged for water.  I felt horrible that I couldn’t help.  When I finally made it home, it was past 5 o’clock in the evening.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt my home in Fuchu-cho, faculty from my father’s school was camping in a tent pitched in the yard.  My grandmother was in the bombing in Danbara and had a deep wound on her shoulder.  Day after day I put her on a bicycle cart and took her to Fuchu Grade School to receive medical care.  But all they had was some antiseptic, which wasn’t enough for my grandmother’s gaping wound, and she passed away a month later from infection.  My 18-year-old cousin, who was working at the phone company in the city, escaped the fire but her health deteriorated, her hair fell out and she also passed away around the same time.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was 16.  Fortunately I am still fine.  But I am sick of war.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 78 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

That was the last time I saw my home in Teppo-cho.  Although I was a college student I had been working at the factory as a Mobilization Workforce Student.  On August 1 we were given permission to start school again and I had begun studying.  The morning service on August 6 had just finished and the piano played in the background as the students exited the Assembly Hall.  I was walking towards my classroom when I saw people meandering about in a blue light that resembled a gas flame.  Then I suffered a blow to my head and went unconscious.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I came to, I was trapped under the building.  I looked around and saw people covered in blood.  Some were calling for their mother.  I didn’t know what had happened and for a while I stayed there, in astonishment.  My classmates were calling out words of encouragement toward each other.  Then I noticed sunlight shining through a hole about the size of my body.  I gathered all of my strength to crawl out and found myself standing on top of the roof that had fallen flat on the ground.  I stepped over fences and clung to telephone poles and finally came to the road.  I heard a voice say,  “Escape, hurry,” so I quickly walked to Sentei Garden (Shukkeien).  We were all walking in bewilderment.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI heard a cry, “Somebody please help. My child is trapped under the house,” but we walked by them in silence.  “The fire is approaching, hurry up”, somebody yelled.  Pushed by the wave of people, I arrived at the riverbank of the Ota River in Hakushima-cho.  The row of houses along the river had caught fire and the flames were coming closer.  Masses of injured people were being brought to the area.  The riverbank was filled with people whose skin was dangling from their hands.  People’s backs were split open, revealing what looked like the inside of a pomegranate.  A soldier ordered me to help him take care of the injured.  The people’s faces were swelling and they cried, “It’s hot, so hot.”  Some dove into the river and floated away.  I was bleeding from the back of my ear and my neck was becoming stiff.  Thankfully I was with my best friend, who kept encouraging me.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI spent the night at the riverbank.  The city was engulfed in red flames and looked like a giant campfire, except in this fire I could see silhouettes of people burning.  The next day, not knowing whether any of my family members survived, I headed for my home with my best friend.  When I arrived I saw my house had burned to the ground.  I found a concrete surface and used a broken piece of roof shingle to write, “Fusako is well.”  Nobody was around, not even the cat.  I found ashy remains of a mother and child on the side of the street.  Another mother in a fire cistern clutched her child close to her body. Their skin was pink like a boiled octopus.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNot having a place to stay, I went to the house of my friend’s relatives, in the countryside.  We walked for about ten kilometers.  We passed by a grade school full of injured people.  I could hear them say, “Water please” from behind the burned masks of their swollen faces.  It was like hell on earth. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOnce I reached the house in the countryside, I fell fast asleep, exhausted and battered.  I didn’t have any other family and didn’t know what to do.  About a week later the Geibi Line opened so I took a train to Yoshida-cho of Takata-gun, and went the home of an acquaintance. We had always planned to go there in an emergency.  To my surprise, all of my family was there, and they greeted me with tears of joy.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe misfortune that was brought by the atomic bomb does not end there.  When we moved to the home of my father’s family in Shimane prefecture, my father, mother, and sister died within ten days.  Their hair fell out and their bodies rotted alive.  At a glance you couldn’t tell that there was anything wrong, but their insides were being torn apart by radiation.  By God’s grace I am still living today.  For that, I am very grateful.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n…76 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

Time flies.  It’s not that I spent the days in obscurity, but I feel as though I haven’t done enough.  Looking back on my life, I realize how seldom I felt well or full of vitality.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDuring the war I was working at the munitions factory as part of the Student Mobilization Workforce.  We were only allowed to attend class once a week.  I had just advanced to college a week prior to August 6, 1945.  The young female students who were full of hope and inspiration were gathered in the Assembly Hall for chapel.  At 8:15 as they were about to exit the building, a single atomic bomb took away their lives.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThey call the atomic bomb that was dropped over Hiroshima “Pika-Don,” but in my memory it is “Pika,” which describes the flash.  The flash blinded me and the 3-story building instantly crushed my nearby classmates.  I wondered how long I lay there.  It was quiet, a space completely void of sound.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs I regained consciousness I heard a hissing sound and felt a puff of air coming from the back of my ear towards my cheek.  Nobody was speaking.  Then the silence was broken by the sound of wooden beams settling.  I felt pressure around my body and was gripped with fear.  I heard Miss N, who had been walking next to  me at the moment of the blast, call from outside: “Is there anybody here?”  The students under the rubble began to yell at once and Miss N dug them out, one by one.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSchool Principal Takuo Matsumoto and another teacher, Mr. Isao Matsushita, rushed over and told us to escape to Mt. Ushita.  I jumped over a tall fence and ran away from the fire without really comprehending what had happened.  I don’t remember how I got there but when I came to a place with trees, I realized I had arrived at Sentei Garden (Shukkeien).  The gardens were filled with burned and injured people, all in a daze, as if they were sleepwalkers.  It was a wonder how they all got there.  Everyone sat quietly in the rain as if they were just waiting for the time to pass.  In a stupor, we watched the fire across the river.  My classmates decided that we should all try to get as close to our homes as we could and so we parted ways.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter the war ended, we were called to school.  I expected to see Ms. N, but she never returned, even on our graduation day.  Later I heard that she had passed away shortly after the bombing.  She must have been exposed to a large amount of radiation when she was thrown in the blast.  It truly is a pity.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI will never forget the fear I experienced trapped under the building.  Time has not erased the vivid memory of claustrophobia and pain I felt under the beams.  I wish I had another chance to speak with Ms. N.  Had she been alive I believe she would have been a friend, dear to my heart.  We would have grown old with each other.  I fold my hands in prayer each day.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThis is my way of recording that fateful moment and my experiences that followed.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI live in peace and gratitude.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 77 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">At the Platform in Minami Danbara</p><p class=\"body_en\">I still remember, quite vividly, August 6 of 60 years ago.  It was such a painful experience that I hardly ever spoke of it until now.  Today I shall recount this heartbreaking event and I pray that this record shall contribute to world peace.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I was born to a family of sake brewers in the Toyoura area of Yamaguchi prefecture.  During the war I attended the Chofu Middle School for women.  Most students were forced to join the Student Mobilization Workforce, and I was assigned to work at the Chofu Factory of Kobe Steel Works.  Our graduation ceremony in March was interrupted by an air raid warning and resumed in the afternoon.  I was looking forward to moving to Hiroshima and attending Jogakuin College, while I stayed with my uncle on my mother’s side of the family.  Much to my disappointment, my entrance to college was delayed due to the escalation of the war, and we were forced to continue working at our assigned workplace.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The entrance ceremony was held on July 30.  From the following day on, we studied under Ms. Shizue Matsubara.  The first lesson was on drawing patterns for the uniforms we were to wear at the Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda).  I didn’t have any materials to make my uniform with and called my mother at home.  My mother was kind enough to buy a train ticket to bring me my grandfather’s black formal kimono, along with some rice.  I took the black formal kimono to school to get Ms. Matsubara’s approval.  Our request to use the kimono was granted, and both my mother and I were relieved.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">After the morning chapel on August 5, the school held a welcome party for us in the training hall at Mt. Ushita.  The training hall was at the end of the rocky trail up the hill.  The freshmen sat in a circle in the great hall and we introduced ourselves to each other. We ate some sweets and played games.  This is one of my fondest memories.  After I returned home from the party, the air raid siren sounded through the night and I hardly slept a wink.  The next morning I was running late from the lack of sleep and an upset stomach, and so I missed the usual railroad.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">My uncle’s house was in Danbara Yamasaki-cho, so I usually took the Ujina rail line from Minami Danbara Station.  I waited at the station for the next train because I didn’t want to miss school that day.  It was important to attend the organizing event held in preparation to leave for the Mobilization Workforce at Toyo Kogyo.  From the platform I heard a plane fly over my head and I looked up to see if it was an enemy plane or a plane from the Japanese Air Force.  At that moment, there was a flash and I was blown off the platform by a violent explosion.  I lay next to the platform and watched the house across the street instantly go up in flames.  Then it got dark and I thought there must have been a bomb dropped nearby.  I rushed back to my uncle’s house.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">My mother, who was still staying there, was quite battered from the rubble that collapsed over her. But despite the injuries, she was safe.  My brother, who was attending Hiroshima School of Industrial Brewery, came home to our uncle’s with another friend from our hometown.  My mother felt it was unsafe to stay and gathered all the food and belongings the four of us could carry.  \nWe headed west towards the back of Mt.Hiji with our rice crackers and canteens.  Taking an indication from the injured walking towards Mukainada, we headed away from the city center.  On the riverbank near Miyuki Bridge were many heavily wounded people.  The dying asked in agony for “Water.Wat…..”  Their voices still pierce my ears to this day.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Downstream, we found a boat, taking people across the river and so we went on board.  Once on the other side, we walked further, took another boat, and arrived at the riverbanks in Koi.  The sun was setting.  The highway along the beach was filled with cars and people roaming about.  When I looked back, the sky over Hiroshima to the east was bright red and gave off an eerie glow.  By the time we arrived at Itsukaichi Station it was around 10:30 at night.  We waited for the midnight commuter train to Shimonoseki.  We boarded and arrived at Ozuki Station around 6 in the morning.  This is where I heard that the bomb dropped over Hiroshima was a new type of bomb.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Finally at home, my grandmother looked at my burns and treated them with persimmon tannin.  She told me not to peel the skin before it healed on its own.  My sizzled hair gradually smoothed out over time.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Four days later, we heard the news that there was a train leaving for Hiroshima from Ozuki Station.  My brother, his friend, and I took the train and saw that the city had been changed into a burned field.  The only structures remaining were frames of taller buildings here and there.  It was a hideous sight.  We arrived at the platform of Hiroshima Station, which had also been reduced to just its exterior structure.  We walked to Danbara.  Many dead bodies floated in the river by the Taisho Bridge and we were reminded of the scale of the catastrophe.  \nMy uncle’s family moved to my mother’s hometown near Tokuyama city.  Our neighbor spoke about the truckloads of dead bodies that were carried nightly to the nearby middle school to be cremated.  Her husband was missing, and she was going in search of him from one refugee camp to another.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">In mid-September, after hearing that school was reopening, I returned to Hiroshima.  We used the school buildings of Ushita Grade School in the afternoon.  We took turns with the middle school, using the classrooms every other day.  They built a shed with a tin roof on Mt.  Ushita.  It was a crude building without windowpanes.  We went to the naval academy in Etajima Island to receive some desks and chairs.  I remember being excited about studying at the desks used by Navy Officers.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">By and by, the campus at Mt. Ushita improved.  New buildings were built for the colleges and university.  A memorial was constructed for the A-bomb victims.  I attend the memorial ceremony every year on August 6.  One year during the ceremony I heard from a teacher that during reconstruction, they found bones of 17 people neatly preserved under the old school building.  A certain surviving family member of my classmate told me of how they still keep the drawings we made in school that week.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I heard the bomb was dropped the moment the students stood up after chapel service in the Assembly Hall.  Those who were near the exits and windows escaped to Sentei Garden (Shukkeien) until the fire chased them away.  My classmates came to the river behind Sentei Garden and took a boat across.  Those who were deep inside the Assembly Hall were crushed under the fallen roof.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">For years I had been concerned about my missing friend, Ms. Fumie Taniguchi whom I had sat next to in class.  When the memorial was moved from Mt. Ushita to the campus on Kami-nobori-cho, I was informed that names of the victims were going to be engraved and I wrote a letter of inquiry to the school.  They sent me the contact information for the surviving family members, and I met with Ms. Fumie’s brother.  He showed me her picture, and I remembered her well.  He told me that after the bomb was dropped, her mother and another brother had searched many refugee camps in Hiroshima.  Although the Taniguchi family’s four sons returned safely from the battlegrounds abroad, their only daughter, who remained in Japan, had died.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I don’t remember my classmates’ names or faces.  We had been studying together for a mere four to five days.  I reflect on the bitterness of fate that took the lives of those students who came from afar to attend class at Jogakuin.  Many of the survivors who had returned to school had dropped out for one reason or another.  There were only a handful of students who graduated along with me after the bombing.  I myself would probably not be here today, had I made it to school at the usual time.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I pray for the souls of the deceased and thank God for my life today.  We cannot allow this tragedy to be repeated.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I shall continue to attend the peace memorial ceremonies.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 76 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">My Friend’s Cry Still Rings in My Ears</p><p class=\"body_en\">August 6, I was 17.  I was commuting from Iwakuni to attend Jogakuin College of Economics.  It was a beautiful morning.  The sky was permeated in bright blue.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nUsually I wore the black long-sleeved school uniform but strangely this morning I was wearing the pale purple short-sleeved uniform.  Now when I look back, I believe this is what saved me from being burned.  The train left Yokogawa Station and stopped momentarily in response to the air raid warning, causing me to be late to school.  Little did I know that the planes flying overhead during the warning were the scout planes for the atomic bomb.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt school some of the students attended chapel while others stayed in the classrooms.  I went to chapel and sat down in the back of the room.  This put me in the position to be able to exit the hall first.  (The concrete building crushed the people inside the hall and most of my classmates were killed instantly or burned to death.)  I had just turned the corner in the hallway when a red-blue flash passed as quick as lightning.  “Wow, what was that?” I remember saying.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe next thing I knew, I found myself lying under a beam of the collapsed building.  I heard someone calling for help.  I wondered for a moment whether we were hit directly by a bomb.  My friend, who was full of life just seconds ago, was dead under a beam and I was covered in her blood.  I had cuts on my head and elbows.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI must escape, I thought.  I struggled in the darkness and finally made it out to the roof.  The Assembly Hall and classrooms were flattened and catching fire in places. The fires were growing fast.  My friends, who stayed in the classroom, were crushed between desks under the school building and couldn’t escape the fire.  It was a living hell.  My friend called, “Help! Help!” and I tried to pull her out of the rubble, but my strength failed me.  There were some who miraculously survived and were running away.  I asked them to help, but my poor friend was wedged tightly in between desks.  “Please help me!  Cut my leg off to save me!” yelled my friend.  It was a shrill cry of one facing death.  The fire surrounding us was getting closer.  I can still hear my friend’s voice ringing in my ears.  All I could say was, “I’m sorry, I’m really sorry I can’t save you.”  She became silent at my words.  Her silence grabbed me and I wasn’t able to run away.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat moment, one of the male teachers ran by and I called him in desperation.  He noticed me and rushed over.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Teacher, my friend is trapped.  I want to help her but her leg is caught and I can’t pull her out”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“You should run away, now!” he said, and I left my friend in the care of the teacher.  I ran by a female teacher who was covered in blood from her head to her fingertips.  I helped her up and fled to Sentei Garden (Shukkeien) with her.  The gardens were full of people but we found a space for her to sit down.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere were injured people, burned people, and people unable to move.  Everywhere I looked, it was people, people, people in hell.  People dead with their heads stuck in the fire cisterns; babies clinging to dead mothers; people trapped in a burning streetcar.  Walking over dead bodies, I finally made it to the riverside where the fire couldn’t reach.  Nearby was a troop of engineering officers, and there were many soldiers lying on their sides.  Their hair remained only where the metal helmet protected them.  The rest of their bodies were completely burned black and had it not been for the mark of their helmets you couldn’t even tell if they were men or women.  They were still alive and breathing faintly.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nPeople fallen on jagged rocks; one after another, not breathing any longer; the riverbank was filled with people as well.  Those who could still speak would state their names and addresses and ask me to notify their families of their conditions.  I cannot forget their desperation to communicate with their loved ones they were about to leave behind.  I saw many soldiers who had gone mad fall over as they yelled “Mother, Mother!” “Banzai  to the Emperor!”  We could feel the heat across the river when the old pine tree at a shrine caught fire.\t</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was an atrocious scene of people asking “Water.Wat….” and others with their burned skin peeling off, dangling from their hands as their skin had become rubber gloves.  I traveled up along the river with a few people who were strong enough to walk.  People were losing their minds.  I saw someone running away holding a large squash.  Another was walking with a cow in tow, headed into the city.  When I came by the Engineer Troops Camp, the campsite and street were filled with soldiers with their bodies burned black and sprawled out.  I passed by, stepping over bodies as I apologized to each of them.  A woman walked by with manure barrels balanced from a bar over her shoulders.  She was carrying a dead child in each barrel.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere is just no end to the madness I saw.  I stopped by a First Aid Station and received care for my wounds.  Then I continued walking for another four to five hours, without even a sip of water.  We crossed the river on a boat and arrived at the Kenjo High School for women where I was told to seek refuge.  They fed us some cucumbers grown in their garden.  I remember the juicy sweetness of the cucumber quenching my thirst.  I savored the delicious vegetable.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nTwo days later I said goodbye to my friends and left for my home in Iwakuni.  I walked all day along the river, careful not to lose my way.  Dead bodies of people and cows floated down the river.  My ability to think or feel had shut down, and I stared at the bodies numbly.  In the evening I finally arrived at Yokogawa Station.  Luckily, I made it just in time to board the first evacuation train.  The two train cars had standing room only and were filled with refugees of the bomb.  I boarded the train and fainted from the sense of relief that I was finally going to get home.  Then I heard an announcement over the platform: they were telling people to ask those who had fainted or fallen over in the train to disembark.  “Are you all right?  Can you stand?” people asked me kindly.  I gathered my strength and stood up.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt took me two hours to get home.  When I arrived home, I found a candle lit in front of my photograph on the Buddhist altar.  My family had assumed I had died, since I hadn’t returned home for three days, and they had heard that the whole city of Hiroshima was destroyed.  When my mother saw me she grabbed my arms in disbelief, just to make sure she wasn’t seeing a ghost.  My sisters were also very happy to see me.  My father wasn’t home because he had gone to Hiroshima to search for me.  Despite my injuries, I was overwhelmed with the joy of getting home alive.  I thanked God for the blessing of sparing me my life.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen people tell stories, it’s not uncommon to exaggerate.  It’s probably safe to say most tales are larger than life, except for the tales of the atomic bomb.  There is no way to inflate the experiences brought on by the atomic bomb.  In other words, an atomic bomb is a cruel and dreadful weapon that should not be used, no matter what the reason.  Nuclear weapons destroy not only human bodies and hearts, but all of humankind.  We must call on the world to abolish nuclear weapons.\n</p><p>\nEpilogue</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI returned to the ruins of my school three months later.  Everything had turned to ash, except for the concrete pillars that marked the front gate.  I prayed for the souls of many teachers and classmates who lost their lives instantly in the 4,000 degree Celsius explosion.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the days that followed I battled the atomic bomb disease, but have since recovered.  I give thanks for the life I have today.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 77 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

The school entrance ceremony was held on July 30 and on August 6 a departure ceremony was scheduled to honor the students going off to Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda), as the Student Mobilization Workforce.  That day I was in Fukuyama city, begrudgingly helping my family as a volunteer worker.  We were helping produce food goods to be shipped to the Ujina Provisions Depot.  My father was drafted and had left for the military.  We had just received a report that my brother, who was in the battlefields in the south, had died in service.  My mother became the head of the family business and employed laborers from the neighborhood.  I helped my mother uphold the pride of a military family and run a small munitions factory.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe outlook of winning the war became less likely by the day.  Cities across the country were being air raided.  Fukuyama city was also raided with incendiary bombs and burned.  My house survived the bombing because it stood a little distance away from the city center.  However, I remember running into the bomb shelter every time there was an air raid warning.  Okayama had been bombed badly, and everyone was talking about Hiroshima being next in line.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat’s when I heard the rumor that a new type of bomb had been dropped over Hiroshima and had wiped out the whole city. I wanted confirmation but there was nobody that actually came from Hiroshima that day and we couldn’t travel there to see it first hand.  In my neighborhood there lived a woman who, two days prior to the bombing, sent her husband off to the military regiment in Hiroshima.  She wailed and asked around frantically, “What has happened to my husband?”  Gradually stories describing Hiroshima as a living hell were recounted, and I grew concerned about my friends at Jogakuin.  I spent the next few weeks in distress, swinging between anger and sadness from the cruel stories.  Later I heard about the many casualties at Jogakuin.  In the single moment of the blast, the fates of the students’ lives were divided and those under the grip of the building died tragically.  When I think of them and all of the burn victims, I feel guilty that I survived. I was supposed to have been at school in Hiroshima that day.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI write this with a sense of responsibility and as a member of the generation that survived the atomic bomb.  As long as we live, we must never allow the cruelty of war.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 77 years old </p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">At the Corner of the Hallway</p><p class=\"body_en\">I was a student of Hiroshima Jogakuin College when the bomb was dropped.  The war was becoming worse and we had not had the chance to study since the school admittance in April.  Male students were drafted to the battlegrounds and women worked as the Student Mobilization Workforce at munitions factories.  Middle school students were summoned to do hard labor at building demolition sites.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tWe were overjoyed when we heard that we were to be allowed to take class for a week in August.  After that, a welcome ceremony was scheduled for the 8th at the Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda) where we were to begin work.  That week was so brief and precious, while we attended lectures, took notes, and chatted away with our fast-made friends.  It was a happy time when we were allowed to forget that we were in the middle of a war.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tOn the morning of the 6th we were exiting the Assembly Hall after morning chapel, and I was walking down the hallway in a hurry to catch up with a friend up ahead.  Just as I came to the corner in front of the large glass doors, I saw an orange flash outside.  The next moment I felt I’d been hit by some tremendous force.  I screamed and fell to the floor, as the wooden pieces of the 3-story building dropped on top of me. I was surrounded by complete darkness and there was much screaming.  Soon, someone yelled in a moment of clarity: “Let’s all calm down!  We shall gather our strength and get out of here.”  We called out to encourage one another.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tThe building settled into its destruction and visibility improved.  I could see by the light shining through the cracks what state I was in.  I noticed some larger cracks that looked big enough to crawl through.  Those who could move escaped and pulled others out.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tOne of my pigtail braids was caught under something and I went into a slight panic.  I finally broke free and saw a teacher looking at me.  He said, “Your eye is cut,” but I didn’t feel any pain.  I could tell my face was wet with blood, the person next to me passed me a handkerchief, I used it to wipe it off my face, and it turned bright red.  But there was nothing I could do about the bleeding.  I had lost one of my inside shoes and wanted to go to the classroom to find another pair, but the teachers told me to flee to safety as fast as I could.  I jumped off the top of the fence onto the street below.  I looked at the roof of the Assembly Hall. It had collapsed onto the ground like a lid. I realized that, had I not been chasing my friend earlier, I would have been trapped without a chance to escape.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tThe first sight I saw when I escaped was of a silent city of death.  The homes and buildings were knocked over and there was a single white line of smoke rising into the sky.  I did not see fire yet. When I jumped down I felt a terrible pain in my thigh and saw that my pant leg was split.  I figured I had injured myself somewhere under the monpe pants, but there was nothing that could be done about it.  My friend helped me to Sentei Garden (Shukkeien), as I pressed on the wound on my face and hobbled along.  Unfortunately the gate was locked, and we walked along the fence to the river.  We saw the houses along the river burning and decided to wait on the riverbank for the fire to subside.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tWe sat under the burning sun and washed our hands in the river.  The ragged people, who were burned, dove into the river to drink the water.  Some died while they drank.  Some men who seemed to be from the 2nd battalion let out a miserable shrill, “Miss, please give me water.”  A young officer who was dragging his leg and using his sword as a cane came over and yelled at the soldiers, “You are an embarrassment to the Imperial Army!”  The soldiers were silent for a moment, until, once again, they begged for water.  I can still hear their voices and imagine their excruciating pain.  The people fleeing the city were almost completely naked and those who were inside buildings like myself were either trapped to their death or escaped with injuries.  It was a scene from hell.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tIt was evening by the time the fire subsided along the riverbanks.  We walked along the Ota River to a friend’s house upstream.  I walked by a front door of a burned house. There was a body burned black and half trapped under the collapsed structure. Its arms were stretched out as if it were grabbing the earth below in excruciating pain.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tWhen we arrived at my friend’s house, her mother was preparing rice balls for the refugees’ arrival.  She fed me rice balls with pickled shallots.  I remember how delicious they were.  I took a bath and changed into my friend’s clothes.  I was so exhausted I wanted to go straight to bed, but they said I should have the wound on my face tended to.  They took me to a doctor who was staying in a refuge nearby.  The doctor was also exhausted and could barely walk.  She had been working at the First Aid Station all day long.  She took one look at my wound and said I needed stitches.  But there was no anesthesia and they used shochu-liquor for sterilization.  I had no choice but to bear the pain.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tMy parents were living in refuge in Jigozen along the Miyajima line.  I knew they would be worried, but I had no way of getting in touch with them.  Four days later I asked for directions and headed on foot for Jigozen.  I met people camping in the bamboo forests, using mosquito nets as tents.  Several times a plane flew overhead and tossed out notices.  The notices said that the war had ended, but I remember not believing it.  I traveled through vegetable patches and along train tracks.  I passed Yokogawa and walked to Koi, where I was finally able to catch a train to Jigozen.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tWhen I reached the two-story house in Jigozen, the downstairs neighbor saw me and called out, “Your daughter’s home!”  It was lunchtime and my parents were sitting at the table crying as they sipped rationed sake. When they heard that I had returned, their tears of sorrow turned to tears of joy.  My father had a weak body, which kept him from being drafted. He worked at the Port of Ujina as a civilian Army employee and had been seeing the horrible conditions of A-bomb refugees.  Worried for my life, he had been wandering from place to place, looking for me wherever he could think of. He knew that many refugees were taken to the island so he took a ship there.  He still couldn’t find me and was telling my mother that he suspected I had died at school.  That’s when I returned.  I looked terrible from my injuries, but he was overjoyed that I returned alive.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tThe following day I went to a First Aid Station the Army had opened in Rakurakuen.  They sterilized the wound with some antiseptic.  They told me that if I didn’t want a large scar I should get stitches on the cut over my right cheek as well.  They too didn’t have any anesthesia, so I tolerated the pain while they gave me three stitches.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tAs the days passed the swelling on my face subsided except for right under my nose, which was tender to the touch. I lifted my upper lip and found some glass buried in my lip and gums.  I used a set of tweezers and pulled out three triangular pieces of glass.  After the glass was extricated, the swelling subsided and my face returned to normal. Then the hairline on the left side of my face started to bleed, in spite of the stitches.  In the beginning the bleeding simply stained the bandages but soon got worse, and I would wake up in a pool of blood.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nCompression didn’t stop the bleeding and we called for a doctor.  The doctor told me the bleeding was due to a severed blood vessel that had never healed because only the skin over it was stitched together.  She asked my mother to prepare a thin silk thread and went to fetch a sterile stitching needle.  While we waited for the doctor to return, my mother sat next to me, pressing on my wound.  Her hands were trembling and slipped.  I was strangely calm and told my mother to put the compression back over the bleeding.  They were fussing over me and there was something peculiarly satisfying about it.  I felt as though I was outside of my body, looking at myself lying in a field of flowers.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tOnce again, I received three stitches without anesthesia but this time I was quite faint and felt no pain.  My mother took the bloody summer kimonos to the river and washed them out.  I stopped bleeding after that.  My body was very weak by then and it took a long time for the wounds to heal.  I continued visiting the clinic until November.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tRight around that time I was told that Jogakuin was resuming class.  After the war ended, little by little, students returned.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tAt the end of the war, the bitterness of our country’s defeat was overpowered by the joy of being able to live without running for our lives.  The scars on my face faded with the passage of time and are now hardly noticeable. But my health suffered, especially after I married and gave birth to my son.  Since the cause of my ailments was unclear, I always suspected it was due to the radiation exposure.  When my second-born daughter entered middle school, she was diagnosed with abnormal thyroid activity, and later when she wanted to get married, her fiance’s parents objected because I was an A-bomb survivor.  They didn’t want to take the risk of having a deformed grandchild.  I felt regret for marrying and having children.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tWe must never forget that our country, after becoming the target of the first nuclear power bomb, vowed never to go to war again.  Too many people have died for this.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tThe more I write, the more memories seem to come to me.  I had kept quiet about being an A-bomb survivor, but I now realize the importance of speaking about my experiences for future generations.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 77 years old\n</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

This means it was also 60 years ago that I was admitted into Hiroshima Jogakuin College.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHow I lost my school registration but was admitted as an honorary graduate</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nUntil a few years ago I didn’t even know that I wasn’t registered at Hiroshima Jogakuin.  I had told many people that I was in the chapel of Jogakuin College before the war when the atomic bomb was dropped.  After the bomb I was immediately troubled by symptoms of atomic bomb disease, and I went to Tokyo in mid-October of that year to seek treatment.  At that time it didn’t even occur to me that I was supposed to have re-registered at school.  My health improved, and my brother and I decided to live together in Tokyo.  Jogakuin’s school principal, Mr.Takuo Matsumoto, wrote me a letter of recommendation to transfer to Aoyama Women’s College before the war, and I began attending school there on the 4th of November.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLater on, I applied for the Atomic Bomb Victim’s Healthcare Handbook  and was required to have two witnesses and a registration card from the school I was attending at the time of the bombing.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat’s when I realized that Jogakuin didn’t have me on the school roster.  They denied my request to issue a school registration card, and at the time I accepted their answer.  But as the years went by, I reflected on how, had I not been at Jogakuin on August 6, I would not have been in the bombing.  The fact that there was no record of my school attendance began to bother me.  I asked Ms. Miwako Takano (54th class of Jogakuin High School) to introduce me to the Tokyo branch of Jogakuin Alumni Association, and the association gladly took me in as a member.  That is how I came to join the Summer Cloud Gathering in 2002.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt the gathering my seniors shared their stories about Jogakuin and the bombing.  I shared my experiences of the war and how I wasn’t on record as a Jogakuin student, regardless of my initial school admittance.  Former principal, Mr. Keizo Nishi, who was at the meeting, suggested I try again for a school registration.  Encouraged, I contacted the school, and this time they admitted me as an honorary graduate.  I would like to thank Principal Tsugikazu Nishigaki and the kind staff in the administration office.  Sharing my stories with my classmates, whom I met for the first time at the Summer Cloud Gathering, was a strange experience.  There was something dreamlike about speaking of being trapped under the concrete Assembly Hall.  The time I spent at the Summer Cloud Gathering will remain in my memory forever.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhat is that light?</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn my old age, it should be difficult to remember something from 60 years ago, and yet that flash of light will never leave my mind.  That day after chapel, I believe the students were just exiting the hall as the piano played in the background.  I was still standing between the chapel pews.  There was a very strange and strong flash and it looked as though the whole chapel swelled with this light.  It was a kind of light that makes you dry in your mouth.  Then the ceiling caved in.  I was showered with pellets of concrete and sand.  I wanted to escape, fearing being buried alive, but I couldn’t move.  My mouth was filled with sand and dust.  I cupped my hand over my mouth so that if I was buried in sand, I would at least have a handful of air left to breathe.  Before I knew it, it had become completely dark and the screams of my classmates stopped.  I felt a sort of a calmness of surrender.  I wondered if others were feeling the same way.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’m not sure how long I was there.  Suddenly there was a hole that opened up above my head and I saw some light.  However, I was unable to get out because a bent metal beam was in the way.  Then the wall collapsed and the size and shape of the hole shifted.  I carefully looked for a way out.  The hole behind the bent metal beam seemed big enough to escape through, but it was high up in the air.  Back then I was very athletic for my size, and I felt that I could reach this hole.  I was gathering my courage when I heard a voice in my heart: “Don’t act alone.  Cooperate with others.”  When I look back on this, I wonder whether this was God speaking to me.  I’m alive today only because I cooperated with the few survivors under the rubble to climb out of the hole that none of us could have reached alone.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nPeople’s faces were bleeding, and some were about to faint.  When I crawled out of the hole, I was shocked to see that the other school building, built from reinforced concrete, had also collapsed.  I helped a friend down the slope of the exterior wall and ran into a teacher, Mr.Toru  Ingu.  I remember saying “What happened?” but he didn’t know either.  He had also been holding up another injured student.  I wondered what to do next.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I was admitted into Jogakuin back in April, the government had ordered us to keep working at our Mobilization workstations until the end of July.  However, for one week at the beginning of August, we were allowed to attend class on the Jogakuin campus.  One day, while school was in session, students were given the instruction to evacuate to Sentei Garden (Shukkeien) in the event of an emergency.  I was not at school that day.  I had taken the day off to take some belongings to a house in the countryside, where my sister was staying in refuge.  This is why I didn’t know to go to Sentei Garden and instead ended up alone.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen in a fire, run downwind</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat was a tidbit that crossed my mind.  The area around Jogakuin was covered with piles of debris and people wandering around.  I sensed there would be a fire.  In the chaos, I saw a fire start so I ran downwind.  I’m not sure what direction that was, but I came to a streetcar line.  I realized it was the rail that led to Hakushima, where a childhood friend of mine lived.  Telephone poles were bent over and power lines were hanging.  I saw the entrance of Teishin Hospital.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was a small group of people walking by.  Their clothes were torn to pieces, their hair stood on end, and the skin on their hands and upper body was peeling off.  Some were pulling a cart carrying belongings.  They seemed to be headed to the river and I followed them.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI arrived at the riverbank by Tokiwa Bridge.  The area was overcrowded with people.  There was a man flailing around on the ground in pain.  I assumed he was a soldier. His jacket had been burned off and his skin was completely red.  There were many begging for water.  Someone shouted; “Don’t give the burn victims any water, or they’ll die!”  All vegetable patches and chicken coops in the homes along the river were raided.  I thought I was in hell.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThen I heard a noise that sounded like shooting from an airplane.  “Everybody get under a tree!” “Students of Jogakuin wearing white should hide!” I heard people yell.  “The river is overflowing: the sandbars are being flooded!”  That was when I decided to leave.  Burn victims who came for water fell into the river.  The pile of floating bodies was getting bigger by the minute.  I looked downriver and remembered a scene I saw in the past, when I watched a person washing a horse in the peaceful river in that exact spot.  How terribly different the scenery looked now!  The woods behind Nigitsu Shrine across the river were catching on fire.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI didn’t go to Sentei Garden or to the drill yard at Mt.Ushita like the rest of my classmates.  I decided that my evacuation site would be the school machine factory in Kawauchi village, where I had been working a week prior to this.  I left the riverbank of Tokiwa Bridge.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI chose my evacuation site, after which my memory is vague</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI left the riverbank at Tokiwa Bridge and headed for Kawauchi village, which was along the Kabe railroad.  A grade school building had collapsed and blocked the road.  I suspected it was Hakushima Grade School.  That’s when my memory started to fade.  I believe witnessing so many cruel injuries and deaths was too much for my young mind to handle.  For the longest time I had assumed that I traveled up Kyobashi River along the dykes from the Nigiitsu Shrine to get to Kawauchi village.  But my memory is vague, and fear has festered whenever I tried to recall.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nYears later, I had a chance to speak about those days when Ms. Misako Ogawa (maiden name, Yamashita) needed a witness to apply for Atomic Bomb Survivor’s Handbook and Insurance.  She had just left Seinan College and transferred to Jogakuin the day before the bomb.  She found me because she remembered my maiden name, Hiraiwa.  Speaking with her cleared up my foggy memory.  Ms. Ogawa was with me at the riverbanks by Tokiwa Bridge.  She walked with me as we crossed the Misasa Bridge, passed through Yokogawa and Gion to arrive at the Hiroshima First Public Women’s High School Worksite in Kawauchi village.  Ms. Ogawa was barefoot, and I took one of my shoes off and gave it to her.  (My recollection of sharing the shoes matched.)  Ms. Ogawa took the Kabe train the following day and made it home to Fukuoka with much difficulty.  She filled in the rest of the blanks in my memory.  I am grateful to have been reunited with her.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe city was burned down: where did my family go?</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter staying in the training hall of Kenjo for a few days, I took the Kabe train to Yokogawa Station.  Avoiding dead bodies, I crossed the burned field to Koi Grade School.  Before the bomb was dropped, it was a Provisions Depot where my sister had been working as part of the Student Mobilization.  However, the site was no longer in operation and not a single person was around.  Then I went to my father’s lab at Hiroshima University of Literature and Science (currently Hiroshima University) in Senda-machi.  Wire netting from the lab animal cages was tangled everywhere.  I saw a typewriter with its keys melted and felt a sense of loneliness.  It showed the intensity of the fire that had swallowed the building.  The inside of the university building was completely silent.  I headed to my house in Takara-machi, approximately 800 meters away.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was afraid to see what had become of my house.  There was a note on the second step at the front door, written in charcoal.  It read; “We’re going to the residence of Mr. Genjirou Sawano in Ushita.”  Suddenly, tears that had eluded me up to this point started to flow from my eyes.  I felt like staying in front of my house for a little while longer, but it was a long way to Ushita, so I left.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHearing the news of my mother’s death</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy father was crushed under our home and became partially paralyzed.  After hospitalization and rehabilitation, he regained his ability to walk and returned to work.  Since then, I heard he was invited to teach lectures at Hiroshima Jogakuin University.  My brother and sisters were safe, but my mother was missing.  That day she had left early in the morning to help at a building demolition site.  Her body was found when Typhoon Makurazaki washed it up on September 17.  We suspect she had died instantly.  We identified her body by the clothes that remained on her body and the sandal strap that I had made for her.  We think the site of her death was near the 387th block of Takara-machi.  My brother, sister, and I cremated her in our front yard on November 3.  I had been experiencing bloody stool for a few days after the bombing and could hardly walk for about a month.  I went to Tokyo University Hospital to receive treatment for radiation exposure.  The doctors told me that my white blood cell count was at 3,000.  They believe that it could have been as low as 1,000 a few days after the bomb.  Today, 60 years later, I am healthy.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy life today</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter graduation I worked until retirement seven to eight years ago.  In the meantime I got married and was blessed with two daughters.  Now I spend some of my time volunteering with other seniors.  From time to time, I become consumed with the urge to do something to prevent war, so I attend peace rallies and demonstrations.  I hope the Japanese citizens will continue to protect peace under our constitution.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 77 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">That Day, That Time</p><p class=\"body_en\">In the days before the atomic bomb was dropped, I was commuting to Hiroshima Jogakuin College by train.  During the latter days of war, all 9th grade students and higher were put in the Student Mobilization Workforce to make weapons.  We were not allowed to bring books to work.  Those were sad days when we were not allowed to study and we were starving for intellectual food.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI really wanted to continue attending school after my last year in high school.  My suppressed desire to study grew, so I caught up with the studies that I missed and took the college entrance exam.  Although I passed and was admitted to school in April, the Mobilization was still in effect and I had to continue making weapons at the factory.  Finally at the end of July we were allowed to the class at school.  My house in Kure was burned in an air raid in the beginning of July, and I was living with nothing but the clothes on my back, but my spirits were high.  I traveled on the train for an hour to attend the entrance ceremony.  The week that followed was filled with joy as I learned in class and began to make friends.  The hardship of war and poverty was of insignificance to me now that I was feeding my hunger for knowledge.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe morning of August 6, I took the 6:30 train to Hiroshima.  There was an air raid warning when we passed Kaitaichi Station and I wondered whether I should head home to Kure. But I was already so close to Hiroshima and I thought I’d rather go to school so I continued on my way.  The air raid warning was lifted while I was walking from Hiroshima Station to Jogakuin, and I was glad that I hadn’t decided to head home earlier.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAlthough there was much pressure against the school during the war for being a Protestant school, the day at Jogakuin began with chapel.  The 3-story college building housed the chapel on the 1st floor.  The upperclassmen were working at factories but we freshmen attended chapel along with the faculty.  We were exiting the hall while the piano played in the background.  Just as I got to the hallway, it came: “Pika”, and then “Don.”   Suddenly my surroundings turned to a picture of hell.  “Help!”  “Mother!” All I could hear was the screams of my friends.  Gradually I began to have trouble breathing.  I struggled for a little while until I realized my mouth was pressed against the back of my friend who was in front of me.  We had tumbled over like dominos.  I turned my head and finally was able to take a breath.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI wondered what had happened.  I realized that I was under the 3-story building that had crumbled to the ground.  Light poured through the crossed beams of the building.  The face of my friend, who I was leaning against, was covered in blood.  I looked at the student next to her, and then at another.  They were all hurt.  I heard some groaning while everyone else continued to cry for help. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI took a look at myself and realized I wasn’t hurt as badly as the others were.  And I was able to move!  I hurriedly crawled up, through the collapsed building, to the top of the roof.  I was surprised to find myself high above the fence.  I looked around but the city that was there this morning had vanished.  The whole town had been destroyed as far as the eye could see.  The collapsed houses in front of the school were already on fire.  I heard cries for help coming from there as well.  I suspected the school building would soon catch on fire and so I jumped down off the fence.  Then I realized I only had one outdoor shoe  with me and I went back in the building to look for the other pair.  I went through what used to be the entrance and found a friend trapped under a beam.  I pulled her with all my might but was unable to free her.  I told her I would find a teacher to come and help.  I ran away in my indoor shoes.  When I got outside again, the heat in the street surprised me.  I ran through the hellish town and picked a place by the river behind Sentei Garden (Shukkeien) as my evacuation site and sat down. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIf only I were a good swimmer, I could swim to the other shore of the river and walk due east all the way back to Kure.  Unfortunately, not only was I a poor swimmer, but the current of the river was extremely rapid, and I figured that any attempt to swim across would be a death sentence.  I sat and looked around at the flattened city.  I could see the mountains that surrounded the city, as if they were within arm’s reach.  I wondered what could have caused such destruction.  Many dead bodies floated down the river as time passed.  The skin of the ever-increasing group of burn victims peeled and hung from their bodies.  There was a soldier whose thigh was split open. It looked like the inside of a pomegranate. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI saw a gray-haired priest breathing his last breath.  I saw a child across the river that was chased to the edge of the river by the fire. He would be burned alive unless he jumped into the river.  I wanted to help those who were asking for water, but there was nothing to carry the water with.  I scooped some water into my hands and rushed over, but by the time I reached their mouths, there was only a drop left.  Soon black rain started to fall, but there was no shelter, and I just sat in the rain powerless.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI wonder how long I had been sitting there.  The tide of the river lowered and revealed a sandbank in the middle of the river.  I walked over to the sandbank and found one of my schoolteachers.  She invited me to come with her to Mt.Ushita where it should be safe.  But I wanted to go back to my parents in Kure and I parted from her.  I also found a friend from Kure who was badly injured.  I didn’t feel I was able to take her back with me, so I suggested she should go with the teacher to Mt. Ushita. I felt pitiless for leaving her, but I reassured her that I would inform her family of her situation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI heard a rumor that a truck from the Kure Navy had arrived a short distance away.  I headed along the river toward the direction indicated.  I could feel the heat of the ground through the thin soles of my indoor shoes.  I saw a truck and asked if they were from Kure.  They were from a neighborhood fire station and gave me a ride.  I don’t remember much about the ride, mainly because I was so relieved to be headed home.  When the truck came to a national highway, the firemen stopped cars to find one headed to Kure. A Navy Officer who was returning from an inspection in Hiroshima gave me a ride in his car.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I returned home and stood in the front door backlit by the setting sun, they said I looked like “Oiwa-san.”   I wasn’t burned, thanks to being protected by the crumbling building, but I was covered in cuts, bruises, and other people’s blood.  On top of that, I was covered in the dirt from the black rain, my hair was in total disarray from being in the dust and sun all day, my clothes were tattered, and my face was pale.  My appearance frightened my parents quite terribly.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nKure was about 30 kilometers away from Hiroshima. News, rumors, and conjectures were exchanged and my parents had given up hope that I was alive.  They were planning on taking a shovel with them to Hiroshima, the next day, to dig my remains out.  I had my father go to the family of my friend, whom I had left behind, to tell them that their daughter was alive.  I was so relieved to be with my parents that my hands and feet started to go numb, and I fell fast asleep.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAlthough the damage to my body was serious, doctors and medicine were hard to come by in bombed-out Kure.  All I could do was to get lots of rest, while my mother tried her best to obtain the most nutritious foods in our meager diet.  It was difficult to get fresh food in Kure and my mother decided to send me to my grandmother’s hometown at Omi Island in the Seto Inland Sea.  I rested and regained some vitality.  When I felt well enough I tutored the neighborhood children and in exchange they brought me fish that they had caught.  The joy of teaching lifted my spirits. Gradually I regained my health.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the fall, the school started re-admitting students and organized classes in the Ushita Grade School building, which had survived the fire.  I saw my surviving friends for the first time since the atomic bomb.  It was shocking to see what a small amount of people I actually recognized.  We just stared at each other, not knowing what to say.  Many people, including the school principal, had lost family members.  We shared our tragic experiences and encouraged one another, as if we were animals licking each other’s wounds.  Enclosed within the sadness was the joy of learning and we carried on with our student lives.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFor a year I was troubled by low white blood cell count, diarrhea, and the loss of my menstruation.  I was plagued with infection in my hands and legs for two years.  I heard about others who were losing their hair and whose gums were bleeding.  I worried that I might be next.  When I was getting married, my husband’s family was against our marriage because I had been in the bombing.  Although my husband finally convinced them to permit us to marry, it certainly was not pleasant to be discriminated against.  I was blessed with a son and a daughter and was relieved that they were born healthy.  But I lived in fear that one day they might develop symptoms of radiation exposure.  When my son was a freshman in high school, he fainted while at soccer practice, and I cannot describe how worried I was while they examined him at the hospital.  We are still haunted by the shadow of the atomic bomb.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe fact that I survived the bomb, so close to the epicenter, is miraculous and I felt there must be a reason that my life was spared. I dedicated over twenty years of my life to teaching small children, until I became plagued with frequent fevers. It took the doctors a year to find the cause.  They found that I had a chronic hyperthyroid.  My weight dropped to 34 kilograms, and my heart palpitations were getting worse. Finally I had to leave work.  Since then, I have continued to get periodical check-ups.  I take a nap when I get tired.  I have learned to live by listening to my body.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI hear the radiation exposure victims on Bikini and other Marshall Islands also suffer from thyroid dysfunction.  It stirs my heart when I think of the ripple of damage that these weapons produce.  The psychological damage done to the children of the survivors is also unforgivable.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter the war I heard that the school found the remains of my classmates who were in the front of the chapel, their skeletons still intact, sitting in their pews.  It is such a pity to think about the wasted lives of my friends, taken in the fire.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI hope that scientists who have conducted experiments and studies on the power of nuclear weapons will speak out to the world.  It is not the responsibility of the survivors alone.  Political leaders must communicate with the world about the foolishness of nuclear war or it might destroy humankind.  This is my humble wish.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 76 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

It was the third day at school on the campus in Kami-nagarekawa-cho.  I was staying in the dorms and went to school after the air raid warning was lifted.  The students were gathered at the Assembly Hall and were just finishing the morning chapel.  As I was about to exit the chapel, there was a bright flash and a thunderous boom as if thousands of lightning bolts struck the ground.  I got down on the floor and covered my eyes and ears.  After a few moments, I heard students yelling, “Help me, teacher!”  I’m not sure how long I was there.  When I opened my eyes, through the billowing dust, I could see the sky behind a beam that had fallen at an angle.  They say people can muster up superhuman strength in an emergency.  I climbed up the beam with little effort and stuck my head out over the roof.  I slid down the roof and fell (or jumped) off the top of a fence and landed on the street in front of the school entrance.  I checked on my friends who had also escaped.  (I knew just a few students since it was only the third day of school.)  We looked for a teacher to ask what our evacuation plan was.  By the time they told us to go to the training field at Mt.Ushita, fires had started in patches.I joined a group of about ten students and followed a classmate who claimed to know how to get there.  We traveled in a hurry.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’m not sure what route we took.  All I remember is everything seemed to be on fire: the trees, houses, streetcars, everything.  Others ran along with us. Some with burned with tattered clothes and some had skin peeling off their faces. They were covered in burns, all over their bodies.  Strangely, I was not afraid.  As I ran, I thought about the gravity of the situation.  Whatever bomb was dropped, it must have been huge.  We came to a riverbank.  I saw many more injured in the same state, around puddles of water.  A soldier rowed a metal boat back and forth across the river.  He said, “Women and children first”.  We reached the other shore, near Ushita.  The training field was up in the mountain, but when we got there, nobody was around.  I grew lonely and worried.  Then a friend said she was going to head home so we stared walking again.  We hiked over Mt.Ushita to Kabe.  In the afternoon we stopped by a Grade School and received a certificate and some rice balls.  We continued on our journey.  We passed through Koi and followed the train tracks, and by the time we got to my classmate’s house in Kusatsu-cho it was already dark.  On the following day, the newspaper’s headlines read in bold letters “Killer Beam (?) in Hiroshima.”  As usual, they reported that, “There were very few Japanese casualties.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn October I received news that school was back in session.  I attended a little while later.  The classes were held in a shabby building with tin roofs.  The desks and chairs were donated from a Maval.Academy.  When it rained, lectures were very difficult to hear because the noise of the raindrops hitting the tin roof drowned the teacher’s voice.  What surprised me the most was the number of students wearing hoods.  When I asked them why, they told me it was because most of their hair fell out.  I heard many horror stories of my classmates’ encounters: “My father and I are the only survivors of our family.”  “A person on fire ran out of a burning home and fell over by the river.”  “There were so many dead bodies that crematoriums couldn’t burn them fast enough.  They turned all the parks in the city into cremation sites.”  I spent the remaining two years of my student life in the recovering city of Hiroshima.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe burned field of Hiroshima has been transformed into a booming city, and hardly anything remains that would remind one of the horrible bombing.  However, many are suffering from the aftereffects and I am not alone in my efforts to prevent a nuclear tragedy from happening again.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I look back over 60 years, I realize I have spent most of my childhood and young adulthood in wartime.  The war robbed us of the best years of our lives.  What were children taught during the war?  They deprived us of our studies and sent us to work, calling it a “holy war.”  I learned the saying “Victory or death,” only to find out years later what it meant was to kill people.  After graduation I worked as a teacher and was put in the position to advocate the importance of peace.  When I speak to students I must teach them that war breeds victims as well as aggressors.  It is difficult to teach young people exactly what it means to be living in peace.  I live in fear that we may be walking down the path to war again.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 76 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I was a young student of 16.  It was a time in my life when I was just beginning to blossom.  Every morning I used to wake at 4:30 to leave my home by 5:20.  I would walk 30 minutes to the Nishi Iwakuni Train Station.  The small station was always crowded with students and commuters.  I would join 3 other friends and sit together.  Today the distance between Hiroshima and Iwakuni can be traveled in 40 minutes, but back then the train took 90 minutes.  We would open the window, and black soot from the steam engine would fly in.  We were poor, but our youth kept us vital as we worked hard as part of the Student Mobilization Workforce.  By August of 1945, the devastation of the war had spread across the country.  Fortunately, Hiroshima had not yet been bombed.  Day after day we continued working for our country, under the hot sun at the Department of Railroads.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the morning of the 6th, there was a precautionary warning before the train arrived at Hiroshima Station.  Soon it escalated to an air raid warning.  When there was a warning, students were usually sent home.  Although it was not the most patriotic attitude, I was secretly happy about being able to go home.  The train arrived at Hiroshima Station and I was about to get on a train back to Iwakuni, when not only was the air raid warning lifted, the precautionary warning also ended.  My friends and I looked at one another and shrugged our shoulders: “too bad.”  We walked to the platform and met up with classmates who came from the direction of Kure.  We waved good morning and chatted as we headed out of the station to walk to our worksites.  Our friends from Kure said they wanted to take the streetcar to work and stayed on the platform at the streetcar line.  I never would have dreamed that that would be the last time I saw them.  The blast blew out the light of their lives as if they were fragile flowers.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe were walking under the blazing sun when, in an instant, there was a sudden,intense flash, sizzling heat, and roaring black smoke.  I couldn’t see anything.  I thought I had died.  I ran frantically.  When I came to my senses, I realized my friends who were walking by my side were gone.  My air raid hood was on fire.  I panicked and tried to stamp it out but the air around me was so hot that I couldn’t put it out completely.  I found a tank of water and dunked it, and put it over my head while it was still drenched.  I noticed both of my hands had been burned black and the skin was peeling off.  Everything but my monpe pants was completely burned off but nobody laughed at the site of a girl half naked.  This was a living hell.\n</p><p>\nI continuously think about how peaceful Japan is now.  When we were young, the dark rapids of war swallowed us up, and many sacred lives were sacrificed.  Now that I am done raising children, I feel like I am at my prime.  I love people, nature, and poetry.  I am whole-heartedly appreciating the joy of life.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n…76 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

Walking to school from Hiroshima station, she was blown over by the orange light in front of the post and Telecommuication Bureau office. She crouched down and then opened her eyes, only to see darkness that gradually regained its clarity from the ground up.  Hearing people and soldiers saying, “Let’s escape to the mountain,” she thought, “To the mountain I shall follow them.” She stumbled over dead bodies and people begging for water and all she could think about was how she was going to die too.

I made small parts for guns.  That day there was a precautionary warning siren around 7 a.m.  I heard the familiar high-pitched sound of the B-29 fighter plane overhead.  Soon after, the warning was lifted.  I hurried to Hiroshima Station to catch the train that leaves before 8 o’clock.  My house was on the 36th block of Teppo-cho in Hiroshima City, near the Hakushima streetcar line in front of Hiroshima Jogakuin.  I arrived at Mukainada Station and joined the group of people that worked at factory No. 7.  I went to the water fountain behind the factory building, with a few friends, before beginning work.  I heard the sound of a B-29 again and looked up.  Suddenly there was a bright flash in the sky over Hiroshima City, and before I could think of what it was, a huge towering white cloud formed.  I watched the cloud turn red, yellow and blue. As soon as I said it looked like a rainbow, I was blown off my feet and fell to the floor of the factory.  After a while, I opened my eyes and looked around but couldn’t see anything in the dusty darkness.  I walked out to the water fountain.  I saw black billowing smoke over Hiroshima.  I realized that the city had been bombed.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nStudents gathered around the front gate.  Nobody knew what had happened and time simply passed, as we grew anxious.  By and by, people with bare feet and tattered clothes started to pass on the street, in front of the factory.  They were headed towards Kaita.  One by one, we asked them where the bomb had been dropped, but their responses were all the same, “Somewhere near me.”  It didn’t make any sense.  I wondered what had become of my home and my family.  What should I do?  My head was in a panic.  But I was too busy to get lost in my thoughts.  There were many injured people being brought to the factory and we had to administer first aid.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe teacher suggested we should walk as far as we could before sunset.  We got into groups by neighborhood and headed towards the city.  We went past the Kirin Beer factory in Fuchu-cho and finally came to the eastern military training ground (currently the bullet train entrance of Hiroshima Station).  We couldn’t get any closer to the city center because of the fire and ended up returning to Toyo Kogyo.  We spent the night watching the sky, above Hiroshima, glowing red.  I told myself over and over that my home and family were safe.  We all must have been saying the same prayers.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt daybreak on the 7, I traveled with the same group along the same route and arrived at Hiroshima Station.  What I saw there was nothing but a burned field framed by the Koi Mountains in the west.  “What’s this?” I couldn’t contain my words of surprise.  Judging by this site, there was no chance of my house surviving the fire.  But I continued to tell myself that my mother and sisters must have escaped.  I hurried toward my neighborhood with a friend.  I saw my first charred dead body at Tokiwa Bridge.  Startled, I ran away.  It was frightening.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThen I saw many other dead bodies in different but dreadful shapes, and each time I ran in disgust.  When I arrived at the site of my home, there was nothing left of it.  Except for the fire cistern, kitchen sink, oven, and bathtub, everything else that could catch ablaze had burned.  I lost the strength in my legs and sat down, only to have to stand up again since the ground was still simmering.  We used to wear getas  back then and I had to keep stepping around to keep my feet from getting burned.  I walked around the house to look for some remains; some sign that would help me decide what to do next.  But I was out of luck.  I stood, staring vacantly at the ashes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThen I saw the one thing that brought me some relief.  My favorite cat was curled up under the sink.  I carefully reached over to touch her but she dashed away.  I chased after her but couldn’t catch up.  I said to myself again that if the cat survived, I’m sure my mother and sisters are fine, too.  Once again, I stood around in a stupor until other survivors began to arrive in the neighborhood and told me that most people who escaped from here ended up in Sentei Garden (Shukkeien) or Nigitsu Shrine.  I rushed to Sentei Garden first.  There were many injured and burned people with glass shards stuck in their bodies.  Soldiers had round marks on their head where their helmets had protected them, but their faces below their eyebrows were burned.  Their heads looked like soccer balls, and their swollen faces were indistinguishable from one another.  The sight was so awful that I doubted that these were actually human beings.  Dead bodies lay everywhere.  I couldn’t look anymore.  It was terrible.  I was nauseated.  I left for the Nigitsu Shrine.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere I met my next-door neighbor, Ms. Toda’s mother, and grandfather.  I was so glad to see them.  Surely this meant that my mother and sisters were fine.  But before I could ask about them, Ms. Toda said “I didn’t see anyone from your family.  They probably didn’t escape since they lived on the second floor.”  I sat down in despair.  Grandpa Toda told me to try searching the area and check the eastern military training gound.  I continued to walk around until dark but didn’t find any leads.  I was getting frightened by all of the dead bodies and didn’t know what to do in my loneliness.  A passerby told me that the Danbara area survived the fire, and I remembered that my mother’s siblings’ house was there.  Their house was damaged but I found my uncle in front of the Hiroshima Women’s School of Commerce.  I cried out with joy.  I told him of my situation and stayed overnight at his place.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEarly morning on the 8th, my uncle and I loaded a cart with a bucket and shovels and returned to my burned down house.  We poked around and finally I found something I didn’t want to find.  It was my mother’s gold tooth.  I found some bones by the front door that undoubtedly belonged to my mother, and near the kitchen, a scull that must have belonged to one of my sisters.  I cried to the skull; “How could you let this happen?  Why did you die?  Couldn’t you have run away?”  I filled the bucket with bones as I cried and cursed.  Finally at my uncle’s urging, I gathered myself together and we returned to Danbara.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the 9th I went to Naka-fukawa where we had stored some belongings.  My mother’s sister and niece welcomed me to their house.  I told them of the fate of my mother and sisters, and we all cried together.  A week later I was shocked to receive news that my oldest sister was alive.  On August 6, my oldest sister, who lived next door, was in the back yard and didn’t get crushed by the house.  She was burned on her arm and was cut by shattered glass but managed to flee to Naka-fukawa.  She was very weak from losing her appetite and suffering from diarrhea and she asked my aunt not to tell me of her condition.  Then suddenly my sister wanted to see her 10-year-old daughter and grandmother, who were taking refuge in Konu-gun.  So I took her on a train and a bus and just barely made it there.  She was granted her last wish.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI stayed overnight in Konu-gun and returned to Naka-fukawa.  I roamed the streets of Hiroshima, looking at names posted at the refugee sites.  Those were sorrowful days.  We weren’t able to identify the bones of my sister’s 4 and 6-year-old children.  My brother-in-law was missing after being out of town on business.  My mother, two sisters, and the 4-year-old child of my third oldest sister all died in the house.  (I’m the fifth daughter of the family.)  My sister who was closest to me in age had stayed home after switching shifts with a friend at the Inokuchi branch office of the Akatsuki Troop.  The third oldest sister was living back at our house after her husband had been drafted.  My oldest sister, who fled to Konu-gun, died on September 1st.  Her hair fell out in clumps, her skin turned purple and she was bleeding from her pores.  I heard it was a cruel death.  Her 10-year-old daughter said, “Mommy is a monster,” and wouldn’t get near her.  This powerful bomb was truly hideous.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was sometime later that I heard that this bomb was a new type called the atomic bomb.  The horror and cruelty of war struck my whole being, and all I could do was to ask in vain; “Why?”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI don’t know the fate of most of my neighbors.  I don’t remember too much about my friends in Grade School and High School.  The young children of the war went to heaven without ever knowing the taste of white rice and candy, or the fun games children are meant to play.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nToday we live in an era where we can buy anything we want.  We take many things for granted.  We must remember that our lives today are built upon the sacrifices made by the war victims.  We must appreciate this peaceful time.  I am finally able to speak to my three children about August 6.  I didn’t want to expose them to such terrible stories until they grew up.  Seven years ago when we visited Hiroshima, I took them to the A-bomb Museum.  Each of them seemed to be lost in their own thoughts.  I told them how important it was for them to accept my distant past, now that I am an old lady.  We should never allow war to happen again.  War destroys everything.  War empties people’s hearts and wipes out all hope and dreams.  I want to value the life I have been given.  The feeling, that in this time of peace people have forgotten to appreciate the precious nature of life, bothers me.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter the bombing, I attended school for a year.  My friend who attended school wearing a scarf over her head to hide her baldness died several years later.  As the years went by, many young people died of atomic bomb disease.  There are many who are still ailing from the aftereffects of radiation.  They are now all seniors like myself.  I lived life to the best of my ability, as if my eight deceased family members had handed over their lives to me.  I feel happy that I have been able to outlive my mother’s age.  I give thanks to the souls that have passed: although turbulent, my life has continued for 60 years after the bomb.  I close this story with my appreciation to all beings.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 75 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

The students who were too weak or sick to work at these sites stayed behind in school.  I was one of the sick until about a week or two prior to the bombing.  Then I was sent to an Army branch office in a temple at Mt. Hiji with four other girls from Jogakuin.  We were the only students there.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhile we there, we took the cremated bones of soldiers who were killed in the battlefields in China and the South Pacific and put them in boxes  after checking the list of names of the deceased.  We attended the morning meeting with soldiers and responded to roll call in military fashion: “I, so-and-so, have accepted cleaning duty today!  I take with me one bucket…”  In the beginning I hesitated yelling out my responses, but I grew more comfortable as I learned that the soldiers were actually very kind.  After the morning meeting, we would jog once around the grounds and then begin our day’s work.  The bones were stored in a cave in Mt. Hiji.  We put the bones in an unvarnished wooden box, put the soldier’s name in it and wrapped it in white cloth.  Then the surviving families would pick up the remains of their loved ones at a memorial ceremony at the temple.  I heard that once in a while the boxes only contained names but no bones.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe soldiers who died at the field hospital had their bones separated from others, but I was shocked to find that the remains of those who died elsewhere were usually grouped together.  All day in the cave we would line up a number of boxes according to the list, put the bones in the boxes using chopsticks, write the names down, and wrap them in white cloth.  Once we finished a batch of these, we invited the families and handed over the boxes at a funeral at the temple.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI used to stay in the dormitories at Jogakuin, but I had some trouble with the meal situation there, and so I had begun commuting from my uncle’s home in Yoshiura.  I boarded the 7:05 train at Yoshiura Station on August 6.  At that time, the female students used the last train car while the male students used the first.  That morning on the train, I didn’t see my friend, Ms. N, and I hesitated to go without her.  Once I even got off the train, only to get right back on.  Once on the train, I saw Ms. Y, who still attended school on campus.  She had been on the train from Kure.  I told her that I had to go to school to get a student identification certificate.  I needed it in order to reapply for my rail pass that was expiring that day.  We walked towards school together, but I stopped when we got to Sakae Bridge.  “I really don’t want to be late to work.  I can come to school during my two-hour lunch break to pick up the certificate.  Could you ask the teacher to have it prepared for me?”  She accepted my request so I turned around.  I took the streetcar to Tsurumi Bridge and headed to the temple.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLater I learned that Ms. Y died in the bomb right after she arrived at school.  Had I gone with Ms. Y to school, I probably would have shared the same fate, too.  It was terribly sad to hear of her death, since we were from the same hometown and were good friends. We even lived for a while in the dormitories together.  I still clearly remember her face and the last conversation we had.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was wearing my air-raid hood when I got to the temple.  Junior Warrant Officer Igawa was telling me that the air raid warning was lifted, and I didn’t have to wear the hood any more.  Just then, there was a strike of bright blue light similar to that of a photoflash, only much stronger.  I covered my eyes with my arm and my surroundings were wrapped in darkness and chaos.  When I came to, I was under the rubble of the office.  Help came quickly, probably because it was the office of the Western Second Unit.  We were rescued from under the rubble.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe blast had thrown my body a couple of meters.  Both of my arms were burned and my head was swelling and bleeding from where I had hit a beam.  Fortunately, because we were in a temple, there were no windows with glass that could have cut us.  It is a miracle I wasn’t crushed under the large beam of the old structure.  There were many people who were lying on the temple grounds, and many of them seemed to have been killed instantly.  I realized that if I had arrived a few minutes later I would have been dead, too.  The kind man who always brought the soldier’s meals was also dead at the steps to the main building of the temple.  My arms were covered in black dust so I washed them off with water leaking from a broken water pipe.  Under the dirt, red flesh was exposed, and that’s when I realized that I had been burned.  The water stung and I regretted washing my arms.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI couldn’t figure out what exactly had happened, but I gathered from my experience of being in the B-29 Kure bombing that a bomb must have been dropped nearby.  Ms. N, who took the later train, arrived at the temple, with her whole body covered in burns.  “A bomb was dropped when I was waiting for the streetcar at Hiroshima Station,” she said.  When I said we were evacuating, she said she would stay.  She must have been tired from walking all the way from Hiroshima Station in her condition.  I said goodbye to her and she stayed behind with a few officers.  I don’t know what happened to her.  But I will never forget the way she looked that day.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA Junior Warrant Officer said he would lead us to safety and took us through Mt. Hiji to the eastern military training ground.  In Mt. Hiji I saw many people who walked around begging for water.  Their arms, held up by their chests, were burned and their skin was peeling off.  Their hair was in a wild nest, covered in dust.  Their faces were round and swollen.  The soldiers, who traveled with us, noticed we were barefoot and got some geta  from a house that we walked by in Danbara.  I found a wooden stick that I used as a cane since I had twisted my ankle.  Once we crossed the Taisho Bridge and arrived at the eastern military training ground, the soldiers left, because they had their military duties to attend to.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI ended up alone with Ms. K, my junior.  She was a dorm student and her home in Yanai was too far to travel to.  I invited her to come with me to my uncle’s house.  We didn’t know what state the city or the transportation system was in.  At the eastern military training ground, there was a horse with burns. It was whining.  There were soldiers covered in burns, except for the top of their heads where their helmets had protected them.  They were crying in pain.  They must have been attending a drill when the bomb was dropped.  There was a medical tent and I went in to get treatment, but all they did was put some iodine on my wounds.  When I heard the tough-looking soldiers moaning and groaning in pain, I got scared and left the tent.  Ms. K and I contemplated camping at the military training ground, until the 2nd General Army Building started to crackle and pop and caught fire.  I dragged my aching leg and we followed the flow of people to Toshogu Shrine.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOnce there, I found a stream and was just about to take a drink when someone nearby saw my burns and said “Don’t drink the water.  If you drink the water, you’ll die.”  I told them that I was so thirsty that I didn’t care whether I died.  I scooped the water in my hands and drank.  Then I heard Ms. Makiyo Sasaki, our physicaled teacher call out, “Are there any Jogakuin students here?”  Her voice was like music to my ears.  Seeing my teacher was like meeting God in Hell.  She told us to head to Mt. Ushita and asked an Instructor’s School student nearby to take us.  I don’t remember how we got there.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI remembered that in the past I was instructed to evacuate to the training hall in Ushita in the case of an emergency.  I was relieved to finally come to a place of safety, when a soldier informed us that the drum barrels there could explode and it was not safe.  “We sent the teachers and students away.  There’s nobody left here.  Please evacuate to another site,” the soldier said.  I was about to break down and cry.  I had been holding myself together under so much stress.  I didn’t know what to do.  Just then, the Instructor’s School student, who I thought had left, passed by the training hall.  He took us through the narrow mountain trails to Hesaka.  He really saved my life, and yet I didn’t even think to ask for his name.  My heart aches when I look back on my rudeness.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBy the time we got to Hesaka, the day was just getting dark.  I didn’t know what time it was, and I remembered hearing the sad whistle of a train.  I looked around at the mountains and the flickering lights in the houses.  I was new to the place and didn’t know where to go.  A passerby saw us standing at a loss and asked me where I lived.  I told him Kure.  “If you go to Kaitaichi Station you will be able to get on a train to Kure from there,” he said.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAll I wanted was to get to my uncle’s house in Yoshiura.  Ms. K and I walked to Kaitaichi.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI don’t remember the paths we took.  We were desperate to get back to my uncle’s house, but it was getting dark and we hadn’t eaten since morning.  Finally we ran out of strength.  A car belonging to the Navy was parked and so we asked if by some chance they might be headed to Kure.  They told me that they had just come from Kure and were on a relief mission.  Disappointed, we just sank to the ground.  The Navy Officers felt bad and said that they would have taken us back if they were headed for Kure.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe were just about to give up and spend the night on the street, when a kind passerby offered to walk with us to Kaitaichi.  He encouraged us and carried me on his back, part of the way.  I nestled up on his back and let him carry me, even though he too was injured.  It’s possible that the sympathetic Navy Officers asked the kind man to take us.  I had no idea where we were, but I remember seeing the Kirin Beer Factory.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe bell for the last train to Kure was ringing when we arrived at Kaitaichi Station.  The station attendant rushed us to get on the train, and I didn’t get a chance to thank the kind stranger properly.  The train was full and people overflowed out to the decks of the cars.  The man who carried me spoke a lot during our journey, and I found out that he was a railroad worker.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe neighbors told my uncle that the armory in Hijiyama had exploded.  He figured that I had died, since he didn’t find me among the truckloads of injured people that were being brought in town.  When we arrived at my uncle’s house in the middle of the night, he was making plans with my sister to go in search for me the next day.  My cousin and aunt stuck their heads out from the veranda and said, “Is it really Shimoko?  How can we be sure you’re not a ghost?”  I took off my burned monpe pants and took a bath.  When I sat down to eat, I was finally able to let my guard down and tears started streaming from my eyes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere are many serendipitous factors that contributed to my life being saved, despite my proximity to the epicenter of the bomb.  I washed the dust off my burns after I was rescued from under the rubble.  I drank water and hydrated my body.  I didn’t know at the time that the ash was contaminated with radiation, and it is possible that if I had been walking around without cleaning myself I may not be here today.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLater, when I spoke to my cousin about how I washed my burns and drank water, he told me that I had given myself the best treatment under those conditions.  My sister was a member of Volunteer Service Corps at the medical room of the Navy Munitions Department, so she was able to get some medicine for my burns from a Medical Officer.  My mother and sister knew how to care for me, thanks to my father whose specialty was to treat burns.  They changed my gauzes daily.  I thank God for these little coincidences that saved my life.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEven now when I visit Hesaka (although the appearance of the town is quite different today), or when I see the Kirin Beer factory (which was torn down recently), I vividly remember that day, 60 years ago, when I walked around helplessly.  It’s amazing how far we as such young girls had walked on an empty stomach.  If Ms. K wasn’t with me, I may have fallen over long before.  I haven’t seen her since that day and my heart fills with gratitude when I think of her.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn conclusion I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart those who extended their kindness to me.  I didn’t even ask for their names, when I owed my life to them.  I wanted to put on the record that in that time of tragedy and chaos, there were many people full of compassion.  I also wanted to note that not all Hiroshima Jogakuin students worked at factories, but also at the temple sorting bones.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 75 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I remember seeing the upperclassmen playing tennis under the cherry blossoms that were in full bloom.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tMy homeroom teacher was Ms. Noriko Matsuura.  We started our day by lining up in two rows in the schoolyard and bowing our heads to greeting each other.  The teachers wore a kimono and Hakama.   The students wore uniforms, with white scarves, designed like that of sailor’s outfits.  I don’t remember when it was that we all started wearing monpe pants.  I remember taking English, Math, Japanese, Science, Music, Clothing Design, Manners, and Martial Arts.  I don’t remember much about Physical Education, except that we ran a lot.  Perhaps our physical Education classes were allocated to the days we spent at the farm in Ushita once a week.  The first year went by relatively peacefully.  The unique school atmosphere of Hiroshima Jogakuin could still be appreciated at that time.  They established the school song.  Recitals were held periodically.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tThe turbulent history of Hiroshima Jogakuin began in 1944.  The upperclassmen were taken away to munitions factories and the freshmen and sophomores came in to use their classrooms.  Prior to that, the freshmen used classrooms in the old grade school. The powers that be at Hiroshima Jogakuin were being bullied by the military. Students worried whether the school would be able to stay in session.  We had already been working once a week in the farms at Ushita.  Now there were days when students were sent to different munitions factories around town.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tIn February of 1945, some Jogakuin students were summoned to the Hiroshima Railroad Department.  Classes were cancelled when the sophomores were mobilized to the Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda), the Railroad Department, and the Department of Treasury.  In April, the new school year started and as a formality we advanced to the next grade but we continued to work at our assigned sites.  We didn’t even receive textbooks for our new school year.  Since I had a weak body, I was assigned to do office work at the Department of Treasury.  In the beginning there were 45 Jogakuin students at the Treasury, but the numbers increased as the weeks went by.  We used to climb up on to the roof during our lunch break, sing psalms, and watch the B-29 fighter planes fly overhead.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tIn August I was taking time off from work to help my family evacuate to Geihoku-cho.  In the morning of the 6th, a flash went off.  Then I heard a roar and the torn paper  of the sliding doors fluttered.  Taken by surprise, I jumped out of the house.  I could see black smoke rise on the other side of the mountains.  The billowing smoke continued to rise all day.  The neighbors said that the power plant in Kake was bombed in an air raid.  Nobody knew exactly what had happened.  Rumors flew across the village in the afternoon.  “They found a 10-yen bill caught on so-and-so’s roof.  Some papers flew over in the sky from Ko-machi.”  I saw some documents with a Zakoba-cho address written on it.  Half-burned documents and prints were carried over by the wind.  People returning from the Kabe area reported that Hiroshima was in big trouble.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tTwo days later, my mother left our village on a search team truck to search, in Hiroshima, for my father. My father, who was a pastor, was working in school administration at Jogakuin.  He had been rescued from under a pile of concrete blocks of a collapsed fence that he was passing by, on his way to school.  My mother finally found him at a hospital in Hatsukaichi 4 days later.  I helped out at the rice paddies at the village with my brother and sister.  We were blessed to have enough food.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tAt the end of September, my mother returned.  I was concerned about Jogakuin and I shared a truck ride to Hiroshima.  I rode in the corner of the bed of the truck with two large cows.  I got off at Yokogawa.  There was nothing left of the city.  I saw the mountains of Nishi-hiroshima, Mt.Hiji, and Mt.Futaba, where the Jogakuin campus was.  They had cleared the roads and I was able to make it to Hakushima.  I walked by a broken water pipe that was still running, that nobody bothered to fix.  I crossed the Tokiwa Bridge towards Mt.Ushita.  I ran into a group of Jogakuin High School students.  They told me they were moving school furniture from somewhere.  I felt I should go to school and joined them.  Later, I went to see my father who was staying in Minami-kanon.  Then I walked to Kabe the next day to hitchhike back to the village.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tOn January 8, 1946, I carried some rice on my back and traveled across through, 3 snowy peaks to Hiroshima.  My father was waiting for me at the training hall in Mt.Ushita.  Dorm students lived in the hall with Principal Matsumoto, and a certain lawyer.  There was a student from Okinawa who was unable to return home.  The students drank from the streams of Mt.Ushita  to fill their empty stomachs and burned dry branches indoors to keep warm.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tIn February, classes began.  At first, there were only two classrooms.  The tin roof had holes and the windows had no glass.  Snow fell on our desks during class.  When it rained, the noise of the raindrops on the tin roof drowned the teacher’s voice.  I remember how eloquently our English teacher Ms. Tazu Shibama spoke in a foreign tongue.  Ms. Tokiko Nagao’s Japanese class was lyrical.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tIn April, I entered the 4th year.  We were still attending class, taking turns with the college students, either every other day, or divided into morning and afternoon.  Friends slowly returned to school.  We couldn’t tell among those who didn’t return whether that had died or had been transferred or whether they were still missing.  Then the numbers of students and teachers outgrew the number of classrooms.  The classrooms were packed.  I think there were over 50 students in the small classroom.  The walls were not sound proofed, since they were built with just one sheet of plywood.  If I arrived late and took a seat in the back row, all I could hear was the teacher’s voice from the classroom next door and would miss the lecture of my own class altogether.  We had a piano, thanks to having evacuated it during the war.  The melody from Beethoven’s 9th played by Mr. Masatsune Yamagami distracted us during class, and Mr. Kaizo Odagiri would reprimand us while the class listened, enchanted by the beautiful piece.  Unfortunately we were also often distracted by the smell from the crematorium in the schoolyard.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn August 6, we buried the bones of the students on the edge of the mountain.  We held a memorial service but the burial site was just a simple mound of dirt.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tIn the fall, Ms. Mary  McMillan took her post as a teacher at Jogakuin.  She arrived in a Jeep, and a few students from the dorms welcomed her.  Her fluent Japanese surprised us.  School was never the same after that.  The classes and campus life began to take on vitality, as if all of a sudden, the whole world had changed.  A Christmas service was held in the newly built auditorium.  Principal  Takuo Matsumoto baptized many students there.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tIn April 1946, a school building was built on the old campus grounds in Nagarekawa.  The high school students moved and the college students remained on Mt.Ushita.  The cultural activities in school increased at an amazing rate.  Recitals and guest lectures were held often.  We even invited Mr.Tatsuo Morito, the Minister of Education, for a lecture.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tMy memories of the days that follow have faded.  Perhaps the days calmed down to an ordinary pace.  I transferred to the new school building in the 3rd year of high school.  We formed a student government, and I was elected vice chairman.  The chairman was Ms. Tsuneko Fujioka, who is now the account auditor of Jogakuin Alumni Association.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tIn the spring of 1949, the six long  years of my days at Jogakuin High School came to a close.  It was a turbulent student life, a life that I would not wish on anyone else ever.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 74 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

Most of us went to work at Toyo Kogyo (currently Mazda) but since I lived in Midori-machi near Ujina at the time, I was assigned to work with a few others at the Ujina railroad station.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt the railroad station, I worked with small parcels along with Ms. Tatsuhara and Ms. Tajika.  Our office duties differed from each other and our desks were in separate places.  As the war worsened, our office became unsafe because there were many army facilities in Ujina.  Due to the size of our department, it was transferred to one of the school buildings at Hiroshima Jogakuin.  The building that housed the classrooms for the first and second year high school students was empty because the students were away at their workstations.  I used to get to work early in order to expedite my duties efficiently and with precision.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the morning of August 6, I got off the streetcar at Hatchobori and got to my office early as usual.  Nobody was in the room yet, but I saw Ms. Tajika’s belongings on her desk and I assumed she was playing the piano on the second floor of the kindergarten building.  I put my belongings on my desk, picked up my official stamp, and went to General Affairs.  General Affairs had its office set up in the art room.  When I entered, I saw Ms. Fujita in the corner, wiping the manager’s desk.  I went straight to the attendance roster, which was lying open on a desk, by the windows on the south side of the room.  Just as I was about to stamp the roster, there was a sharp hissing sound and a flash of light ran across the windows.  The windows of a small building sandwiched by the gym and Art room flashed brightly.  I was startled, but continued to press down on my stamp.  Then I walked two or three steps towards the entrance, wondering what the light was.  That’s when I lost consciousness.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI have no recollection of the sound of the bomb or how I became trapped under the building.  I’m not sure how many minutes had passed.  I heard a small voice, “Help, help…” as if I were in a dream, which grew louder as I came to my senses.  I was surrounded in darkness and couldn’t tell what was going on.  Slimy liquid poured out of my head onto my face, and slowly I gathered that I was bleeding, laying face down under the fallen building.  In the midst of voices calling for help, I heard Ms. Fujita, “Help, I can’t breathe.  Please get this off of my neck…” But help never came.  I heard Ms. Fujita say, “Goodbye, everyone.”  And then I noticed I could no longer hear the voice belonging to my senior, who had been saying, “If I escape, I’m going to help all of you get out.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI felt the need to urgently do something.  In the darkness, I called out to Ms. Nakaoka whose voice seemed to be closest to me.  She answered immediately so I asked her “Is there a place to get out somewhere?”  “I’ll take a look,” she said, and shortly later, “We can get out here!”  I wiggled my body towards the direction that she indicated, and soon I saw some light.  I scooted over further, but there was a mass of wires that had spilled out from above the ceiling, blocking my way.  I closed my eyes and passed under them.  That was the most nerve-wrecking experience the whole of that day.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I finally stood on top of the collapsed school building and looked at the schoolyard, I was astounded.  The yard was eerily quiet without a single soul.  I could tell that all of the school buildings had collapsed, but there was a grey haze and I couldn’t tell what had happened to the buildings by the biology classroom.  It certainly didn’t look like what a campus should look like on a summer morning.  A ghostly atmosphere hung in the air.  To me, this was the most shocking sight of August 6.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI gradually started to lose control over myself and when I looked down at my feet, I couldn’t remember how or where I had just come from.  I could no longer hear anyone call for help from under the rubble.  When I looked around, I saw a man crouched down on top of the collapsed building.  When I took a careful look, I realized it was Mr. Yoshida from General Affairs.  Mr. Yoshida’s crew-cut-head was covered with bumps.  He held his head in his hands as blood dripped out and he seemed to have lost his drive to even say a word.  Just then, a clerk who escaped from the Kindergarten building rushed over to us and said “You should get out of here, at once”.  I hesitated because Mr. Yoshida didn’t seem to be in any shape to be running away.  The clerk said, “I will take Mr. Yoshida with me.  You must go now.”  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI looked over towards the kindergarten and noticed that the homes across from the kindergarten were catching on fire.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt first Ms. Nakaoka and I weren’t sure which way to go to get around all of the rubble.  Then I remembered that between the Kindergarten and school building there was a fire cistern that had recently been put in.  In order to be able to access the water tank from outside of the school grounds, a part of the brick wall fence was torn down.  We walked around the edge of the cistern and jumped down to the street.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the street there were many refugees walking in a line.  They seemed to be covered in dust and I wondered if they had all escaped from under collapsed buildings and homes.  The line moved silently towards Hakushima, bending towards the right after crossing Tokiwa Bridge.  We wanted to go towards the farm in Ushita so we turned left after crossing the bridge.  When we passed by the Nigitsu Shrine, a large tree on the temple grounds was on fire.  The leaves on the branches that were outstretched to the street were burning furiously, and I was worried that a branch might break and fall on us.  We ran past it in a hurry.  We walked along the river and turned right onto a small street that led toward the Jogakuin farm, until we realized the houses along this street were also on fire.  We gave up going to the farm and walked instead towards Ushita-waseda, in order to get into the mountains.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe found a tent on a flat clearing after hiking up the mountain road a little ways.  In the tent were a few Army officers, a chair, and desk with a machine that appeared to be a communication radio.  There were also a few civilians resting there and we decided to take a break.  I sat in a daze, except for once in a while I would be gripped by fear that at any moment American soldiers might come down from the sky in parachutes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAround noon, two women came into the tent.  They happened to be clerks from the same department as I.  They were walking from Hiroshima Station towards Jogakuin when the bomb dropped.  One fell to the ground immediately and was fine, but the other suffered terrible burns.  Her face was swollen and her eyelids were sealed together.  She kept saying, “I can’t see…  I want to see my mother…” The skin on her arms was peeled off and dangling from her fingertips.  It was such a pitiful sight, and I could not look at her for too long.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEvening came and we wondered what had become of the city.  We decided to hike down the mountain to take a look.  We stopped at a field by the river. It appeared to be a workplace for the Engineer Troops.  To the right of the entrance was a large group of resting civilians, and to the left lay soldiers, who suffered burns to their upper bodies, waiting for first aid.  An Army officer arrived and I had a feeling that he was there to assess the area.  I gathered my nerves and went to ask him if he knew anything about the state of the neighborhood where I lived.  He told me that my neighborhood was undamaged.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat was the happiest moment that day.  It seemed I had a home and family to go back to.  We wanted to leave the field immediately but it was getting dark and we didn’t know what lay between here and home.  We gave up going home that night and headed to Ushita, where Ms. Nakaoka had an acquaintance.  The people at the house in Ushita were very kind and welcomed us to stay overnight.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe next day I was able to go home.  My only injuries were the cuts from shattered glass (I still have some pieces buried in my arm) and a dislocated left shoulder (which was put back in place by my Judo coach).  It is painful to think about how people who were in the same place as I lost their lives while I am still here, living.  For 60 years, I have lived with this wavering feeling.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 74 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

At 8:15 a.m., the air raid warning was lifted.  Relieved, we returned to our workstations.  Suddenly there was a strange flash and a blast that scooped me up in the air as if I were a speck of dust on a broom.  When I looked towards the entrance, I saw an eerie mushroom cloud towering in the western sky, like the devil himself.  The whole sky was covered in a reddish-black haze.  Since the air raid warning had been lifted, none of us suspected that a bomb had been dropped.  We speculated that a gas tank had exploded, and we all worried whether our homes and families were safe.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen we returned to our stations, the first load of injured people arrived in trucks and carts.  They were completely naked and burned badly.  Their skin hung from their bodies like seaweed, and some had heads that were split so badly that you couldn’t tell which side the face was on.  Eyes bulged out and lips swelled. It was a sight unfit for this world. Then the people who traveled on foot began to arrive.  The never-ending line of people looked like something straight out of hell.  They stuck their arms up in front of their bodies and walked in silence.  It was indeed the march of the dead.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWork was cancelled and the factory became a First Aid Station.  Our seniors ordered us to administer care, but no one knew where to start.  The most we could do was to bring water to the people who kept begging for more.  Then we were instructed to give water to only those with 2/3 of their bodies burned.  We were confounded trying to figure out which patients qualified for water.  Later we found out that this was to try to save those whose injuries were light.  The room was filled with an awful stench.  It was difficult to breathe and I was too nauseated to eat lunch.  The sky turned dark and big black raindrops fell.  Then the scorching sun returned.  We ran out of space on the floors to lay people down.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLate in the afternoon we were instructed to travel home in groups by neighborhoods.  I joined the group going to Hakushima, led by a few students from Hiroshima University of  Literature and Science.  Just then I saw a red fireball rise above the town and my legs trembled.  This may have been the setting sun reflected in the sea of fire against the sky.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was absolutely no reliable information.  We silently hiked over the peak of Nakayama and arrived at the town of Ushita in the dusk.  When we passed by the Eastern military training ground, we met a staggering group of female students.  Someone asked, “Isn’t that your sister?” and I looked at one of the girls in the group.  Sure enough, it was.  She had a bandage on her grubby face and held a kettle in one hand.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy sister was a sophomore at Hiroshima Jogakuin and was working at the headquarters of the 2nd General Army Headquarters, deciphering codes.  When the 2-story barracks collapsed and caught fire, a naked soldier, whose clothes had burned off, pulled my sister out of the rubble and saved her.  He pointed at a kettle that was on the side of the street and told her “put some water in that and run away.”  She didn’t think the soldier, who was covered in burns, made it out alive.  We will never forget the dying soldier’s kindness as he rescued my sister and sent her on her way with life-giving water.  I was fortunate to run into my sister while nobody knew of their family’s whereabouts.  I felt a sense of relief that I was not alone any longer.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFrom Ushita, all we had to do was to take a 5-minute walk from Kanda Bridge to get home.  But when we arrived at the bridge, half of it had burned down.  The heat from the burning bridge wrapped our bodies and we couldn’t go any further.  “I could be reunited with my parents, if only I could cross this bridge,” I thought.  I stood in front of the sea of flames that parched the sky and prayed seriously for the first time.  “Please God, if it is your will, help me.”  I felt my soul cry out.  Just then, a phrase from the Bible echoed in my mind that I used to be terrible at memorizing.  “Heaven and Earth may pass away, but My Word shall never pass away.”  “The things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal”.  That day, the words of the bible became my reality and scripture took on a new life to me.  August 6 became the new beginning of my life.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOur group decided to return to the Toyo Kogyo, tracing our footsteps.  We were twice as tired from the disappointment of not being able to return home.  I don’t know how many dead bodies we stumbled over on the way back to the factory. “Water!”  “Help me!”  Raspy voices and countless outstretched arms blocked our way.  There was nothing I could do.  I just walked past the groaning people cold-heartedly.  My heart still aches when I think of how sinful and powerless I was.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMany of the injured people died that night without the chance to see their families or utter their last words.  I saw many babies who clung to the cold breasts of their dead mothers.  We took a nap near sunrise and were ordered by the head of the factory to get ready to report to work in the morning.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“I can’t work when I don’t even know if my family is alive.  Please let us go home once again!” I cried in desperation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Do you call yourself a Japanese citizen, you idiot?” he yelled.  “You are a disgrace to the Student Workforce!”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“If you’re so proud, you can stay here alone and work.  I’m going home no matter what!”  I left the factory.  I didn’t think I would ever return to the factory, and the thought made me bold.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhat surprised me on the way back that morning was that all the black logs that I had assumed were fallen poles were actually heaps of burned humans and horses.  They didn’t look like anything that used to be alive.  They were piled everywhere and there was hardly a place to take a step.  The bodies of shirtless soldiers were stacked on top of one another like cinder.  My heart ached as I looked at the dead bodies of all shapes and sizes. I wondered if any of them were my mother or brother.  The sun beat down mercilessly and the land smoldered.  Countless flowers of oleander bushy sadly bowed their heads.  I remember how the flowers swayed in the wind as if they were enduring the cruelty that surrounded them.  Alas, trees and plants cannot run away!  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Oleander, my sorrow is renewed on the anniversary of the atomic bomb.” (Haiku poem)\n</p><p>\nAs we continued on our journey, one by one, my friends split off from the group.  As they went on their way to find family members, we promised to meet each other at Mt.Ushita in case we couldn’t find anyone.  Since I was up at the training hall at Jogakuin the previous night, I knew Ushita was a safe place.  In the end, my sister and I were left alone.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe city of Hiroshima had burned down overnight and we had lost our sense of direction.  We were wandering around, not knowing which way to go, when we ran into a teenage boy from our neighborhood.  He said, “Your family is by the riverbank of Ota River.  I’ll take you there.”  I was ecstatic.  It was indeed like, as the saying goes, “being saved by Buddha in Hell.”  This boy was a famous bully in our neighborhood and usually everyone avoided him.  But as we walked, he consoled us by saying things like “don’t be sad because your home burned down.  Your family is fine, and that’s what really matters.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt took us about two hours to get to the riverbank where my parents were.  They were taken aback to see my sister and me together. They said it was like a dream.  Unfortunately, we were still missing our cousin from Osaka, who had been living with us since June.  The next day we went out separately to search for her in different refugee camps.  I went to see a kind old lady from my neighborhood that I had heard was badly injured.  She suffered from a terrible burn, and the blisters that covered her whole body from head to toe were oozing with wiggling larva.  Her face was also deformed from the burns and she could hardly open her eyes.  I was at a loss for words when she asked me, “Let me see a mirror.  I want to see what my face looks like.”  I had a mirror, but I lied, “I don’t have one with me.  Just keep your eyes closed so you don’t get blinded by the bright sunlight.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“My whole body is hot,” she said.  I immediately went to a nearby vegetable patch to get some cucumbers, sliced them thin and put them on her body. “Oh, that feels so much better.  Thank you very much.  Please don’t be afraid of my appearance.  You can come and visit me again, no matter how ugly my face is.”  Those were the last words I heard from her.  She passed away shortly after my visit.  Her husband was a teacher at Hiroshima Shudo Middle School and was on night duty the night before the bombing.  She left her home early in the morning to bring him some breakfast and was waiting at the streetcar stop near the epicenter when the bomb was dropped.  The blast threw her all the way to the next streetcar stop.  The couple didn’t have any children, and she had cherished me since I was a little girl.  Her husband stacked up some firewood in their front yard and, all alone, cremated her body.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAround this time, we finally heard that the bomb that was dropped on the 6th was a new type of bomb.  Rumors spread across the city that vegetation would not grow on Hiroshima’s soil for the next 70 years.  My cousin never returned and to this day, we don’t know what happened to her.  I remember seeing my mother get down on her hands and knees in front of my aunt and bowing down on the scorched earth in apology for losing my cousin.  At noon on August 15, while we settled into life in a room on a farm, we heard the news over the radio reporting the end of the war.  There was much static and it was difficult to hear the exact words, but we got the gist.  I was suffering high fever and diarrhea.  When I heard the news, I took the scrap of wet cloth, which I was using to cool my forehead, covered my face and sobbed.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn September 17, Hiroshima was hit directly by the typhoon Makurazaki.  Our room was flooded up to 50 centimeters below the ceiling.  The river, that just a month ago was piled high with dead bodies, changed into a raging muddy river.  I watched houses coming down the river and being sucked into roaring swirls while there were horses and cows still on the roof.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe surface of Hiroshima’s river</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nPregnant with misery</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the sad glow of neon</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBrings back memories\n</p><p>\nIt was my first real Christmas!  The students of Jogakuin huddled in the drafty building made of salvaged lumber while the wind of the snowstorm blew through the chapel.  Soldiers from the occupation troops joined us.  Our joyful voices echoed across Mt.Ushita as we sang “Joy to the world!”  My friends, who wore black hoods to hide their baldheads, and others, who had terrible scars on their faces from burns, all thought of Jesus Christ, who was born in a manger. We sang at the top of our lungs.  We had lost so much, and yet we realized God had finally given us the gift of peace.  I felt the importance of never letting go of peace.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe year I graduated, I got baptized in Yanai Church in Yamaguchi prefecture.  I made the choice without consulting anyone.  I moved around often and had to change jobs each time.  Whenever my life seemed to come to a standstill, I put myself back on the day of August 6 and started afresh.  But it was very difficult to bear the weight of the label put on A-bomb survivors.  I especially had difficulty forgiving people who would ask such insensitive questions like, “Is Pika-Don  an infectious disease?”  Whenever I lost all hope for life, the scripture “And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption,” (Ephesians 4:30) gave me strength and curbed my death wish.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhile I lived in nothingness as if I were a migratory bird flying from one job to another, the church and YWCA taught me to use my mind and creativity.  I joined the pacifist movement and attended study groups for anti-war, anti-nuclear weapons, the Okinawa conflicts and Japanese constitution.  I realized I was not just a victim but also an attacker.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI feel we do not have the right to pray for peace unless we look at our own history and learn from our past mistakes.  “It is a sin not to inquire and learn about what you don’t know.”  I take these words to heart, spoken by the Koreans living in Japan.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nToday, I don’t think I am the only one in apprehension of soldiers’ creeping footsteps, preparing for war.  Okinawa is practically at war as we speak.  I believe we must take responsibility for our actions.  There cannot be foolish wars, kidnapping, child abuse, or murdering one’s family, if we pray before we act and reflect upon whether or not we are “grieving the Spirit of God.”  I am only one person and cannot make a large impact on the world.  But I strive to be a good Christian who continues to send out peace in my daily life.  I close in prayer.\n</p><p>\nEpilogue</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt has been over half a century, and yet when summer visited again I was struck by that indescribable stench of death from that day.  The smell seemed more intense and seemed to last longer during this exceptionally hot summer.  It forced me to put down my pen many times.  As I prayed and reflected, I realized that the smell might have been the death throes of the many that died without having a chance to say anything.  I decided to take in this stench rather than reject it, to continue to hold these messages of the dead.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 74 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I was taking my brother to refuge in Yae.  We got on the 7:15 bus leaving Kamiya-cho.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe passed through Kabe and the bus was driving up a mountain road.  Suddenly the bus shook violently as if it were going to tumble over.  I clung to my brother and looked out the window.  We saw a cloud in the shape of a mushroom.  The people on the bus said there must have been a secret armory that exploded, so I didn’t worry about Hiroshima and I took him to the school children’s refuge site.  I got back on the bus to head home but they wouldn’t drive past Kabe.  The trains had also stopped and the small town of Kabe was full of people who were seriously wounded?those who were terribly burned, those with fearsome skin eruptions, those who were bleeding profusely.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was a sight I had never seen before. Trembling, I walked along the train tracks.  When I got to Midori-machi where we were taking refuge, I heard that the whole city of Hiroshima had burned.  My sister and I sobbed together.  My father returned and gave us the details.  The night sky was dyed red.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn August 7, my father and I went to the city to look for our other family members.  We walked to Yokogawa but had a hard time walking on the hot road, which was still sizzling. We would wet our feet with water from broken water pipes.  The bridges were skewed, and the roads were filled with dead bodies covered in tattered clothes and blood.  Bodies in tanks were bloated, even though the water around them had completely evaporated.  The stench of burned hair and skin was so terrible that I vomited every now and then as I walked.  When we came to Aioi Bridge, I finally came to the realization that Hiroshima had vanished. I clung to my father and cried out loud.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe only building that I saw was the Fukuya Department Store.  We walked through Hatchobori, the first block of Teppo-cho, and finally we found our house was completely burned down and still hot.  Only the bathtub and grinding stones remained.  I thought about what my family may have been doing on the morning of the 6.  I dug around and found my mother’s bones by the front door.  Around the grinding stone were bones of my grandmother, brother and sister.  I brought back their bones in a copper pot.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI think it was August 9 when my father and I went to Mt. Ushita to report to the school that we were alive. I remember how Mr. Hisashi Harada was happy to see me.  I was very disappointed to hear that the teachers Mr. Takaji Shimazaki and Ms. Fumi Yoshikawa didn’t survive.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 74 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

According to my father, he had escaped to Sentei Gardens with my oldest sister, who was 17 years old and a student at Hiroshima Jogakuin College.  While he was nursing his cuts that day she passed away.  My sister (the third oldest) was a 1st year student of Jogakuin High School and was working at a building demolition site when she suffered full-body burns form the bomb.  We found out that she was taken to the aid station at Oko Grade School.  She was bleeding endlessly from her nose and her pores until she died silently, without saying “it hurts” even once.  How painful it must have been!  She had lived about 10 days.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe sent off my youngest sister and the three of us moved to my father’s hometown Obayashi (in Asakita-ku of Hiroshima).  Suddenly I was plagued by the aftereffects of radiation exposure.  When I put a comb to my hair, it fell out in clumps all at once.  As a young woman I didn’t want to lose my hair so I stopped combing it.  No matter how hard I tried to keep my hair, whenever I touched it by accident, more fell out and within a week I was almost completely bald.  It was truly sad.  My youngest sister was still young (1st grade) so she didn’t mind losing her hair as much.  Her vitality returned even though she was bald, and she would smile when a man from the neighborhood teased her and said, “I could go get a cow’s tail for you to put on your head.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAll three of us suffered badly from the radiation and we vomited bloody clumps into a basin, and my father had bloody stool for days.  The high fever I was experiencing seemed to go away as soon as I threw up the bloody mass. Now that I think back on it, I guess that was my body’s way of releasing toxins.  I recovered.  I heard my aunts speaking in the next room about how they would have to hold three funerals for us.  Nobody knew what was wrong with us and someone said that our symptoms were similar to diphtheria.  My cousin, who was a nurse, went to Kure to get shots of blood serum. But as soon as I was given the shot, I could no longer stand up and my skin got infected even after something as trivial as a mosquito bite.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt must have been about 6 months after the bombing.  I was losing a lot of weight, my menstruation stopped, and I lost my vitality.  On the other hand, my father began to recover his strength and he started taking his bicycle into Hiroshima all the way from Obayashi.  He must have been motivated by the thought of rebuilding our family home.  By April the next year, he had prepared a small and humble shack for us.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe were happy to have this small shed in the middle of the burned field.  My sister ran around our new home in joy.  When we looked out at the field, we could see the sea at Ujina in the horizon.  But at night it looked as though the sprits of the dead were glowing in the dark rubble.  My father found a square piece of wood and carved the words; “Alas, the grave of Takenaga mother and children.”  We folded our hands in prayer everyday by the grave:</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMother (43, Died in the bomb blast) we still don’t know how.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n1st born daughter (18, Died while attending work as a Jogakuin College student) after fleeing to Sentei Garden that night.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n3rd born daughter (13, Died while attending work as a Hiroshima Jogakuin High School student).</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the rubble that was said to be barren, I found a single brush of oleander blooming with red flowers.  I remember feeling like there was hope.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nUnfortunately I cannot erase the sad memories from my mind. They continue.  After the war, I had to say my final goodbye to my father who ran an ancient art dealing business (he died in 1963 of cancer of the esophagus).  And my sister died last year (May of 2004) after fighting cancer for 8 months.  I still have a hard time believing that she is actually gone.  It seems like she is still alive, somewhere far away…</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSo, I lost my only flesh and blood and here I am, alone.  I’m not sure what I am going to do with the short time I have left to live.  I wonder what I will leave behind.  I wonder if I will continue to carry the heavy burden of the atomic bomb.  Luckily, I am surrounded by my daughter, her husband, and my cute little grandchildren.  I do not take my good fortune lightly.  I thank the souls of my dead family and those who died in the bombing.  I believe I have built my happiness on the foundation of their sacrifices.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhenever I must part with a family member, I remember how for 60 years I dragged along the fact that our whole family was in the atomic bombing.  It is true that I have hesitated to speak about my past since it was such a terrible experience.  Now as the 60th anniversary comes along, I am sharing these stories with my children and grandchildren while my memory is still clear.  I pray that the light of peace shall continue to shine.  I will continue to walk and pray in Peace Park each morning.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 74 years old </p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">The Four Dimensional Flames</p><p class=\"body_en\">It has been almost 40 years since I, a genuine Hiroshimaite, moved to Nagasaki.  Six decades ago I stood under the mushroom cloud of Hiroshima.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945 when I stood at the back entrance to Icchu Middle School in Zakoba-cho of Hiroshima.  It was a mere one kilometer away from the epicenter.  Back then the government was dismantling homes in a grid pattern, to prevent the spread of fire in the event of an air raid.  As a second year high school student, I was assigned the job of collecting shingles and lumber from the demolition sites.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nJust then, I was standing at the front of the row of students and was talking with my friends about koden .  My classmate’s brother was killed in the Kure air raids, and we were trying to figure out how much we should contribute as a koden.  There was an explosive sound of an airplane above.  “That’s strange, I just heard the siren that signals the end of the air raid alert,” I thought, and just as I looked up a bright flash lit up everything in sight.  The flash looked like lit magnesium.  This powerful light had such a force that its weight pressed down on me.  I was yelling as I fell down flat, my arms flailing as if I were trying to swim into the ground.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI must have lost consciousness.  I’m not sure for how long.  When I came to, I saw the bright blue sky.  There was not a single cloud.  It was a clear, pleasant, beautiful, bright blue sky.  I had ducked down to the ground, but somehow I was flipped over and on top of my chest lay a thick concrete wall of the fence.  It was unbelievable.  I wondered if this was a dream.  For a while I simply looked at the sky in bewilderment.  It’s so beautiful…  I’ve never seen a sky like this before…  “Help, God!”  “Mother!”  I heard from afar.  The survivors who couldn’t move were crying for help.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy proper grandfather, who didn’t drink, smoke, or even sit cross-legged, used to tell me many tales from the past.  He raised me, his favorite first grandchild, to love literature.  “Dear God, is this reality?  Could this really be happening?” cried out the girl who loved literature.  I saw a shadow of a person move to the right.  It belonged to a man who was wearing tattered clothes and was holding his arms out like a ghost.  His face was so bloated that it looked like a crab and I could barely make out his expression.  He was the only person in my field of vision.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Mister, help me!  I’m over here, get me out!”  I shouted as loud as I could, but there was no response.  I realized I wouldn’t be able to rely on anyone to help me.  I had to get myself out of this mess.  When I moved my body, somebody yelped in pain.  There was someone else under the fence.  Since I couldn’t move, I just kept my body stiff, looking up at the sky.  I noticed the concrete that was pressing down on my chest was, until a moment ago, a portion of the fence that belonged to the house above the rock barrier.  I wondered what on earth had happened.  If this was a nightmare, I wished I could wake up soon.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was a crackling sound.  Black smoke soiled the sky.  It seemed there was something burning in the direction above my head.  I had to escape, even if I caused pain for someone below me.  I moved my body gently.  This time there was no voice.  “Oh, my shoe…”  Under the thick concrete, one of my khaki shoes made of cardboard and canvas fell off.  But I couldn’t be bothered.  I scooted my shoulders over, swung my hips, bent my legs and inch by inch, scooted up.  It was a miracle that I was able to get out from under the heavy fence.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI wonder how much time had passed.  I no longer had any sense of time.  When I got out from under the fence, I looked down at my leg.  Through a tear in my monpe pants, I saw in the darkness the skin over my left kneecap had split open. It looked like the inside of a pomegranate.  “No, I’m not hurt” I said to myself as I stood up.  It seems people get their sense of direction from buildings.  Now that all of the buildings around me had vanished, I couldn’t tell which way led to the station.  There was a flow of people walking back and forth over the rubble on the paved road.  Stepping on the debris, I headed to the road.  I still don’t know why I went that way, but in any case, I did.  I walked in the brilliant sunshine as I tried to wipe away the worry about my knee.  “It’s really nothing.  I’m not injured,” I said over and over, as if I were casting a spell on myself.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI want to go home.  But I wonder which way I should go?  Then,  “Ms. Sakoda,” said a voice suddenly.  The voice belonged to a girl holding her arms up by her chest, whose facial features were melted off and whose torn clothes were hanging from her body like seaweed. “It’s me, Tadaoka.  I was working at the luggage room when there was a loud boom and it got dark.  Everything disappeared.  Take me with you.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was class leader and my sense of responsibility awakened.  “OK, come with me,” I said and took her hand.  Her tender skin shifted in my hand.  “Ouch!”  She had been burned terribly.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Follow me,” I said simply.  The people walking by weren’t bothering with anyone else.  They all passed by as if they were on some mission.  “Ms. Sakoda, I can’t walk anymore.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“No, you’ve got to walk.  Come on, be strong,” I grabbed the end of her clothes and pulled.  We saw a horse and carriage approach from afar.  “I can’t walk anymore.  I’m going to hop on!”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nGetting on the carriage meant that she would be headed back to the way we came from.  What difference did it make?  We were moving under the operation of a hopeful outlook that if we went somewhere, there will be something waiting for us.  We didn’t ask for permission to take a ride, and the driver didn’t tell anyone to get off.  There was a cool-headed sense about the situation, the reality of everyone having to fend for themselves.  And at the same time a strange bond between people was formed as the boundaries of ownership blended away.  I pushed my friend up onto the back of the carriage.  We didn’t even say goodbye.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was a muddy puttees on the ground by my feet.  I wondered why anyone would throw it away.  I picked it up and tied it around my pomegranate of a knee.  “That should do.”  I started walking again, alone.  The road came to a river.  Firemen, clad in their uniforms, tight girdles and iron helmets, were instructing people at the foot of the bridge.  “How do I get back to Koi?”  Finally I was meeting someone that could give me directions.  “You can’t get to Koi.  It’s impossible, the whole city’s on fire.  You should cross this bridge and flee to Hijiyama.”  I couldn’t quite give up and so I asked the next fireman.  “Which way to Koi?”  “There’s no way to get there.  The whole town’s a mess.”  This young girl, who just last month experienced her first menstruation, couldn’t get home.  I wandered back and forth in bemusement.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe tide was high and the river flowed in a quiet indigo.  I turned around slowly and saw nothing but destroyed homes, some plumes of smoke rising, and a few lonely buildings along the white concrete roads that forked out in two directions.  Ahead of me across the bridge was a streetcar line and I could tell that the houses along the riverbank had started to sizzle.  This area seemed to be on a transportation route and from time to time, trucks arrived and parked by the foot of the bridge.  People passing by would climb onto the trucks under the firemen’s instruction and were carried away.  I didn’t want to get on a truck.  It felt like they would be taking me further away from home.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’m not sure how long I was squatting there.  Suddenly, I noticed the opposing riverbank was spitting sparks and burning wildly.  I wonder if it was an illusion that I remember seeing bright red flames even though it was in the middle of the day.  I heard burning wood crackle and pop, and the biggest fire I have ever seen unfolded before me.  People did not challenge this fire.  They just watched it burn.  Water from tanks, bucket relays, sandbags, fire dampeners made of coarse rope and bamboo sticks with a sharp diagonal cut… nothing would stop this fire.  In the luggage room where Ms. Tadaoka had been working were a heap of air raid hoods and emergency kits that the students of the Mobilization Workforce always carried.  The first aid kit contained a triangular cloth for slings, scissors, tweezers, a selection of medicines, and roasted rice and beans in a tea can.  That was supposed to be enough to carry us through emergencies, and yet, none of those things were of any use, either.  The muddy puttees wrapped around my left knee had become loose and made a coil around my ankle.  I tugged and pulled, but it just kept falling.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe citizens of Hiroshima all believed a bomb was dropped directly over them.  They all waited for help to arrive.  But after waiting and waiting and finally realizing that help was not on its way, they understood that they had to get through this on their own.  All of our daily preparation and common sense went out the window.  We were all thrown into the crucible of an unprecedented disaster beyond our imagination.\n</p><p>\nFour kilometers from the epicenter, in the western town of Koi, my mother who was 35 and in the last month of her pregnancy was caught in the bombing along with my three brothers.  My father in the Civil Defense Unit was at his post in the city.  My mother had just put to bed my almost 2-year-old brother who had been suffering from colitis for a month.  From the window in the bathroom she saw a flash reflect against the roof of the main house.  Then there was a large boom.  “The house was bombed.  A flare bomb was dropped on the house,” she thought.  The bathroom door wouldn’t open.  She banged and kicked the door open and ran through the outside hallway.  She picked up the youngest one.  In the meantime, the shingles, walls, windows, and glass were showering down everywhere.  She wondered for a moment why a fire had not started even though they had just been bombed.  She pried the backdoor open, stood out in the side alley, and saw that everything had turned into piles of rubble.  She had no idea what could have just happened.  Then people from the city started arriving in clusters, dragging their tattered clothes, their skin hanging from their faces and hands, their arms held up in front of them like ghosts. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was a bomb shelter under the house but it was so terrifying that she didn’t feel like going underground.  It seemed like fire was spreading from the direction of the post office.  She grabbed the rice that she had just cooked and that was still in the pot. She also grabbed cans of medicine, the safe, a sewing machine, and anything else valuable she could find and threw it in the large neighborhood fire cistern. Then she escaped to the mountains.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAround that time, black clouds covered the sky and a shower of black rain fell.  People started rumors that the Americans were showering them with gasoline and were planning to bomb and burn them all.  At sunset my father returned with a chief Buddhist priest, who was working with him in Air Defense.  They said they held hands and ducked under flames to get home.  Since then, it has become their habit to say how they would have never made it alone.  Out of the eleven members who were mustered to the Defense Unit from Kure, they were the only two who survived.  Nobody knew what became of the others, and their bodies were never found.  The two things weighing on my father’s heart were the fact that I was missing and that he lost the metal military helmet in his care.  But as soon as he returned, he headed to Koi Grade School to help as a volunteer fireman.  He took care of the refugees that gathered in the crowded assembly hall.  In a few days, larva started to grow in the people’s wounds and my father picked them out.  He moved the dead bodies to the middle of the schoolyard, stacked them up, and cremated them.  After his shift, he would go out into the city to find me.  Once, when he heard the buzzing of a plane and threw himself into a ditch, someone tried to take the straw hat he was wearing.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Hey, I’m still alive!” he yelled, and the stranger apologetically gave it back.  “Father always goes to help other people in the moment of crisis, and is never of any use to his own family,” was one of my mother’s pet phrases.  As a man of the Meiji era , it was his characteristic to save face.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nRelatives from my father’s hometown Saeki-gun came to pick up my hungry and lonely mother and her children.  After the black rain, the relatives took my 3- and 5-year-old brothers on a bicycle, and my mother took my sick brother in a stroller and headed to the countryside.  By the time she arrived at the relative’s house, the two brothers, who had arrived there earlier, were crying at the top of their lungs.  The relatives were at a loss with what to do.  Once my mother settled into the house, my absence started to weigh heavily on her heart.  She no longer cared about our renovated home that we just moved into a month earlier or any other material thing.  She just wanted her daughter to be alive.  She is alive somewhere.  There’s no way she is dead, she believed firmly.  And yet, the image that kept coming to her mind was of her first-born daughter tumbling around on the floor in pain from her burns.  Just this morning her daughter had left the home in a hurry, saying she was going to be late.  How could she let her leave, just like that?  Why didn’t she say “Yasuhiro’s not feeling well, and you’re father is gone.  Why don’t you stay home”?  Why did she let her go to school?  They don’t even let her study!  Regret filled her heart.  “Get your nose out of those books and help me with the house work!” she would yell at her daughter.  She shouldn’t have yelled at her.  I wonder what she is doing now.  What has become of her? She questioned as she watched her sons who were romping around, now content that their mother was with them.  Desperately, she pushed aside her dark worrisome thoughts and told her self, she’s alive, I know my daughter is alive.\n</p><p>\nThe fire across the river roared intensely and I could feel its heat on my cheeks.  I supposed it would scorch the heavens and burn until nothing was left.  The fire’s intensity was so strong that it didn’t even seem real.  As I watched the flames, I thought about the survivors of the Kure air raids.  Those who survived the blasts from the bombs were caught in the fires that started everywhere and were burned alive.  They said the only survivors were those who jumped into the river.  The river!  I shall dive into the river in front of me.  When I descended the stone steps to the water, I saw a raft with a few people on it.  The water slopped against the stone steps.  I figured the water was about as deep as my height.  I treaded water and slowly made my way to the raft.  Once I reached the raft, I noticed I couldn’t control my left leg.  Having grown up a tomboy, I couldn’t comprehend why something as simple as climbing onto a raft was giving me such difficulty.  No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get up.  It must be because of the wound, I realized.  I had been pretending that the wound wasn’t there.  I glanced at it and saw a gaping diagonal wound of about 15 centimeters above my knee, and on the inside of the flesh were blue blood vessels crossing from left to right.  I wondered if the yellow chunk about the size of my thumb was fat.  There were two or three pomegranate mouths here and there, looking quite devilish.  I didn’t see a single drop of blood.  The flesh was a soft white like peeled shrimp.  It seemed more suitable to describe the wound as some unwelcome creature stuck on my leg.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe puttees fell off in the water.  I have no recollection whether I still had one shoe on or if I had bare feet.  I decided to bite the bullet and get back on the shore.  The raft was already full and people were still trying to climb on.  I’ll survive, whether I stay in the river or not.  My conviction was strong.  I wonder where this confidence came from.  I walked along the riverbank with the flow of people and headed to the outskirts of the city.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere were people just like me who were walking with nothing but the clothes on their backs.  Others had backpacks and bundles of belongings under their arms.  People with tattered clothes and some neatly dressed, all gathered together and walked in the same direction, headed for safety.  It was silent.  “What did you do to your leg?” asked a young woman who was passing me by.  “Oh, you poor thing, use this as a bandage.”  She took out the standard triangular cloth from her first aid kit and wrapped it around my knee.  I was grateful.  I didn’t think to ask for her name.  “I’m in a hurry, I’ve got to go,” she said.  She was the only person who spoke to me.  I wonder if she is still alive.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA water pipe whose faucet was blown off violently squirted water out.  Suddenly I was thirsty.  I stepped on the debris to reach the pipe and gulped down the water.  I took a break and drank, took another breath and drank.  I gulped down as much water I could take in and then started to walk again.  I remembered the firemen at the bridge saying that the Army Clothing Depot(factory for military uniformus) up ahead was being used as a First Aid Station.  That’s where I’ll go.  But there was no such thing in sight.  Then I came to a house partially destroyed.  By the entrance I saw a faucet in the area for washing your feet.  My young and innocent mind thought I should drink as much water while I could.  I wasn’t very thirsty but I twisted the faucet and drank.  I sat down in the shade of a pine tree.  A cool breeze blew… soon I would wake up… and realize… that this was all a dream…</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nTired, I lay down, but suddenly I became nauseated and threw up violently.  I didn’t have enough strength to get up and clean it up.  I just turned my head to the other side and lay there. The half-destroyed home seemed to be a dormitory.  But there wasn’t anyone around to put sand over my vomit.  I’m not sure when or how long I fell asleep.  I awoke with a chill.  The nightmare was reality.  I was struck with the urge to go to the bathroom.  I picked up my right leg, then I tried to prop up my left leg, but it wouldn’t move.  It was as if I had a heavy rock tied to it.  The weight on my leg kept getting heavier and heavier.  The devil was sitting on it.  I tried again, to no avail.  My left leg had become a boulder covered in moss.  The sun was setting and there was nobody around.  The urge to urinate kept getting stronger.  My leg wouldn’t move.  I wonder how long it took me to twist and wiggle into a position where I could finally relieve myself.  By the time I was done, I was drenched in sweat.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI suppose this is what they mean when they say “in a fire you muster superhuman strength.”  Encountered by an unprecedented shock, I swam and then walked several kilometers with my damaged leg, without feeling any pain. But now that I had sat down and had taken a rest, my leg would not even move.  Inch by inch, I scooted myself away from the puddle of urine and vomit.  On any other day, this injury was serious enough for a few adults to rush to my rescue, strap me on a board, and carry me to a hospital.  The girl who had nobody to rely on but herself mustered up all her strength to scoot away from her excrements.  I pondered over whether to spend the night there or try to make it to a First Aid Station.  It seemed the choice was already made for me.  I just can’t get anywhere under these conditions.  Then I found a stick about the length of my height.  It took a long time to push my body over to the stick.  I took breaks in between and finally fought myself up.  “It doesn’t hurt.  It’s not heavy.  This wound really isn’t anything,” I told myself with each step I walked.  Then again, I’m not sure you could call it walking.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was a painstaking and laborious journey.  The large sun was setting on the other side of the vegetable fields.  Surrounded in the beautiful dark red world, I advanced about 10 meters every 30 minutes.  An old lady carrying medicine walked toward me.  She was on her way to gather some water.  “Where is the Army Clothing Depot?” I asked.  “Oh dear, the Army Clothing Depot is all the way over there.  You must have passed it.  They’re treating wounds and taking care of people there, you must turn back.”  How long was the road back to the clothing depot!  After all that effort to get to where I was, I had to turn around.  I leaned on my walking stick and step by step, continued to sidle along the road.\n</p><p>\nThe Army Clothing Depot was crowded but rather organized.  A man in his 40s, clad in white, gave me 11 stitches.  There was no anesthesia.  I don’t remember his face.  He wrapped my knee tightly with white bandages and I rested on the floor on a grass mat assigned to me.  Once I lay down with a blanket, I was content.  I noticed I had burns of about 5 square centimeters on both of my elbows.  They stuck a tag on my chest with my name and address on it.  Lying down calmly, I looked up at the ceiling and felt overwhelming happiness and gratitude, after my experience of walking through hell.  My single-grass-mat colleagues surrounded me.  Most of them were writhing from their burned full body, front body, or back body burns.  Some couldn’t lie down and others couldn’t sit.  The sides of their bodies that were showered by radiation, had suffered burns, but at the time no one knew how all this had happened.  The relief workers cooked rice porridge in a large pot, ladled it into bowls, dropped a single pickled plum in each, and handed them out.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI took the bowl in my hands but could not bring myself to eat it.  There was a middle school boy next to me whose eyes were swollen shut and whose mouth was deformed from burns.  He was slurping down his porridge.  “Kin-chan, right?” I asked.  “Yeah, who is it?”  He replied.  He couldn’t see well.  “It’s me, Sakoda”  He was the son of a neighborhood restaurant owner, and I had gone to the same grade school as he.  We promised to go home together.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe refugee camp at night was a living hell.  I could hear explosions in the darkness.  “Help!”  “I’m scared!” “Mother!” Terrified shrieks swirled around.  Until then, we used to brag about watching air fights and B-29 bomber planes fall and crash, but after August 6, we would get shaken up just from the sirens of the air raid alerts.  Hearing explosions frightened the life right out of us.  The darkness added to the fear.  The absence of sounds of explosions didn’t necessarily put anyone at ease, either.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThen the babbling would begin.  “Oh, look, bubbles!  One bubble, two bubbles, three, four…” the counting went on and on.  Sometimes a bubble would burst.  “It disappeared!  It’s gone.  Bubbles… oh, look, bubbles!  One, two…”  Sometimes the bubbles kept coming, up to seven or eight hundred, and at other times, they would burst after ten.  Then, competing with the bubbles,  “Hari Mao, it’s Hari Mao!  You’ve come to save us.  Great!  Hari Mao of Malai…  Hey, everyone, it’s Hari Mao!” a shriek of joy praising the hero, would echo in the room.  Adding to the mix were groans protesting the pain, crying, and a whiff of bad smell.  The voices of the darkness knew no end.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDaylight was welcome!  Having suffered minimal burns, getting my wound treated, and being of a sane mind, my biggest concern now was how to go to the bathroom.  I would leave my grass mat, crawl on the floor, go down the stone steps to a quiet place hidden from others’ view.  I still didn’t feel like eating the porridge being served at the front steps.  I kept drinking and filling up on water.  The hard-and-fast rule seemed to be “don’t give the patients water,” especially the patients with burns, since it was thought to give water to burn victims would cause death. The patients begged for water, panting and gasping here and there, but nobody would bring them any.  When the voice asking for water stopped, that was when they were dead.  For me, the only thing that would get past my throat was water.  Every time I went to the bathroom, in desperation, I would secretly fill up on water.  I figured if I died from it, I would be better off.  (This was actually what contributed to my detoxification.  It was also good that I vomited.  My body was able to keep a reserve of strength because I couldn’t walk.  I realized later, that for me, all signs pointed to LIFE.)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBy my grass mat, which had become my whole world, an old woman came into view. A bandage was wrapped around her head, covering her right eye, which was swollen shut from being hit.  It was Ms. Ono, my sewing teacher from grade school.  She used to wear hakama  and swing around her ruler when she got mad at us.  “Oh, you too are alive.  That’s good, it’s really good we’re alive,” she took my hand as tears streamed down her one eye.  She told me that Ms. Tai, who was from the same class, was here with full-body burns.  Ms. Ono sent her brother, who was visiting from Kure, to all of our parents to give them the news of our survival.  (I heard later that Ms. Tai died before her parents could come, and Kin-chan died shortly after arriving home.)\n</p><p>\nI endured three dreadful nights.  Around noon on the 9th, my uncle and cousin arrived with a bicycle cart from the countryside to pick me up.  They brought canned tangerines, which was a precious commodity at the time.  Today I don’t even like canned tangerines but that day it was the most delicious and superb food on earth.  I ate without even taking a breath.  “What are you going to do with the can?  I need a can,” said a man nearby.  I noticed everyone around me was watching me eat.  It was obvious they didn’t really want the can, but the content still left inside.  I took a large breath and offered it up.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy uncle, who was fully expecting to pick up my dead body, stepped on the pedals like a shogun returning in triumph.  The burned city was still sizzling.  I saw a body that had been crushed by a telephone pole, but left the body uncovered after the pole burned away.  Floating in the river, there were bodies bloated to three times their normal size.  Hell had stuck around with its gaping mouth here and there.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt took three hours by bicycle to get to my father’s hometown on the edge of Saeki-gun.  It was a place filled with fond memories of my childhood summer breaks. I used to chase my father on my children’s bike to go visit our ancestors’ grave, and later caught tadpoles in the stream.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was a hubbub of people coming out of my uncle’s house.  I saw a tangerine box with one side torn open with two small feet sticking out.  The child was wearing a familiar looking yukata .  I had stumbled upon my 2-year-old brother’s funeral.  “Mrs. Sakoda, Mrs. Sakoda!  She’s alive.  She’s fine and has come back!” someone called.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy mother came out in disarray, unable to hide her emotional confusion.  Her legs would not move, and she just stood there.  The stuff welled up in her eyes and distorted her vision.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“She was alive…she IS alive!”  I was one of less-than ten survivors out of the two hundred and something students at Zakoba-cho.  And this was the starting point of an even more turbulent era in my life.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 73 years old\n</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">700 Meters from the Epicenter</p><p class=\"body_en\">My family lived in Eno-machi of Hiroshima but moved reluctantly to Tokaichi-cho (closer to the epicenter) when we were forced to give up our house so it could be dismantled .  On August 6, my aunt, two brothers (5 and 3 years old), and I were at home.  My mother had left on August 5 to go see my brother (5th grade) who was away for the Pupil Evacuations.  My father had left his five family members when he received the Red Paper (draft call) in August 1941 to fight in the Japan-China War.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt that time I was in the second year of high school.  I was staying home that day, not feeling well due to lack of sleep: the air raid warnings kept going all night.  The moment I came out of the bathroom that morning, there was a sudden roar.  I was trapped under the house and I fainted.  I regained consciousness when I heard my aunt calling me from somewhere above.  I answered in desperation.  My aunt was peeling the shingles off the roof, one by one, from where she could hear my voice.  I fought tooth and nail to get out to the voice calling me above.  By the time I was free, we were surrounded in a sea of fire.  I couldn’t even scream from the fright.  My aunt dug out my bothers from under the rubble and we fled, the 3-year-old on my back and the 5-year-old on hers.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe used the building of the Western Telephone Company as a target to run to, but the streets were completely covered in debris.  We weaved through people crawling out from under the destroyed homes, groaning and unable to move from their injuries.  We dashed like mad and came to Hirose Bridge.  The rails were already on fire and the bridge was about to collapse.  We kept walking due west.  The river was full of people who jumped in to escape the heat.  I’m not sure how many hours we had been walking.  I ran out of strength and sat down when we came by the next river.  I reached to my back and noticed my brother was still clinging on with all his strength.  I was overwhelmed with joy and hugged him tightly.  Tears flowed from my eyes.  Then I started vomiting and experienced uncontrollable diarrhea, and was unable to leave the river.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSuddenly the sky was covered in clouds and black rain showered us.  As I got soaked, I watched in a state of bemusement as my brother and others were dyed black.  Then, snapping out of my daze, I looked at myself and realized that the bottoms of my bare feet were tingling in pain from burns.  My clothes were tattered like everyone else wearing rags.  Red and swollen dead bodies lay about.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe moved towards the railroad and climbed up to the tracks and saw the city completely engulfed in flames.  We spent the night together and the next morning received a rice ball from the relief workers.  I will never forget how delicious this rice ball was.  We camped out for a whole week.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMaggots ate away at dead bodies and the burn victims with skin dangling from their bodies wandered around saying, “Where is the First Aid Station?  Would you please give me some water?”  The number of casualties increased by the day and an awful stench hung in the air.  The scene from hell burned an image in my eyes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe decided to stay with our relatives in the countryside (Gono village of Takata-gun, Hiroshima prefecture).  Fortunately we didn’t suffer too many injuries because we were inside of the house at the time the bomb was dropped.  About 20 days later, all four of us took to bed with a high fever.  My aunt’s internal organs bled and she continued to discharge bloody stool.  She suffered until the end of her life of 32 years.  I was unconscious with a high fever for several weeks, so I didn’t know my aunt passed away while she slept next to me.  The one thing I remember from that time was how she spoke to me in a rare waking moment: “Judging by the way of things, we’re probably not going to survive.  Let’s meet in the next world.  Don’t be afraid of dying.”  In those days our minds were engraved with the idea that dying during the war by “being a shield for thy holiness emperor” was an honor.  And yet the death of my aunt was such a pity and brought me remorse.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy hair started to fall out and my body was covered with purple spots.  My skin began to swell up and pus seeped out.  I spent six months lying on the floor before I could receive treatment.  My wounds were finally treated but have left keloid scars today.  My brothers also lost their hair, but they gradually began recovering as fall came around.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFor 57 years I could not bring myself to think of that time, much less speak about it to others.  It was not until recently that, at the urging of my distant relatives and friends from the Ladies’ Club, I realized the importance of sharing my stories as a living witness of the atomic bomb.  I felt as though my deceased classmates were calling out from heaven to encourage me to speak.  This memoir is the result of my hope that it may in some way help the world.  It truly took a long time to come to this resolve.  There is absolutely no need for nuclear weapons, and I am troubled by the state of the world today.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThis may seem short, but this is the fruit of my labor of remembering and crying, crying and writing.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n(Taken from a magazine article 2002)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 73 years old\n</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I had to work at the building demolition site in Zakoba-cho to clean up. “Good morning,” “good morning,” said the teachers and students gathered at the schoolyard.  Who would have imagined that this would be the last morning of their lives?  We left the schoolyard and headed to Zakoba-cho at 7:30 a.m., as we sang full of spirit, “The young cherry blossoms are still only buds”.  I suppose we arrived at the work site a little past eight.  We put down our emergency kit that we always carried and went to work.  Someone called out, “It’s a B-29,” and there was an abrupt flash.  I lost consciousness.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’m not sure how much time had passed.  Suddenly I came to my senses and the area was pitch black.  I was lying on the ground.  I could hardly breathe from the dense dust that pervaded the air.  Oh, what shall I do?  What had I been doing?  My heart filled with angst and loneliness.  When I tried to get up, I felt someone’s body on my leg.  “Mommy, mommy, help!” I heard someone yell.  I was crying, too.  I may die like this.  I wonder if I’m going to be burned to ashes.  My heart turned anxiously with survival instinct.  I had no idea which way to run.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nGradually the air became clearer.  I was shocked to see the state of my friends.  They were covered in blood, or burned black and everyone’s hair was standing on its end.  Normally this is something that you would want to avert your eyes from.  Grease dripped like sweat from my scorched hand.  It had a strange smell.  It’s impossible for me to stay here aimlessly.  I followed in the where people were headed.  Cries for help came from every direction.  Someone was sobbing and screaming while their lower body was stuck under a concrete wall.  Shouts begging for help came from under the collapsed houses.  But everyone ran past in indifference.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’m not sure how long I wandered around.  The changed city gave me no clue as to which direction I was headed.  Then I came to a bridge.  I figured out later that it was Hijiyama Bridge.  A horse tied to a telephone pole kicked and fussed, covered in blood.  I crossed the bridge barefoot as the sun beat down on me.  I sat down on the riverbank.  I saw girls from another school covered in burns, drinking the dirty water of the river.  “I want water.  I want to drink,” they said.  It was a pitiful sight.  From the top of the bridge someone yelled, “You’ll die if you drink the water!”  One of the students went into the river as she cried, “I want to die now!”  She must have been suffering terribly.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was picked up by a relief team vehicle and taken to Ujina.  They evocuated me to Ninoshima Island.  On the ship I saw a woman burned naked writhing in agony on the floor.  Once I arrived at Ninoshima Island, they treated my wounds with care and I began five days of my life that I would never forget.  The refugees shared one big room, put grass mats on the floor, and slept with one blanket.  People were dying around me, left and right.  Everyday I was surrounded with people that I couldn’t tell whether they were dead or alive.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the second day, I heard the lady lying next to me utter her last word, “mother.”  Just then an older woman walked in.  It was her mother.  “Mommy has been searching for you all this time.  I should have come sooner.  I was a little late, wasn’t I?” she cried, clutching her dead daughter.  We all cried with her.  I want to see my parents and brother, too.  I want to go home.  But there was nothing that could be done no matter how I longed to leave.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the fifth day in the afternoon, I opened my eyes to a voice calling my name.  Oh, Father, how long it has been!  Tears flowed from my eyes.  My father also sobbed and for a while neither of us could speak.  We just cried in joy and relief.  I wonder what would have happened if I weren’t reunited with my father then?  It is a thought that brings me the shivers even to this day.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDeceased October 17, 2001\n</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I was just l3 years old, a junior high school student at Hiroshima Jogakuin. In an instant flash my classmates and hundreds of thousands of people were killed by the powerful force of the bomb.  The entire city was reduced to rubble and ashes.  A few days later, a second bomb was dropped in Nagasaki, resulting in similar destruction.  Japan soon surrendered after witnessing the annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  For the Western world, the atomic bomb was hailed as the deciding factor in winning the war.  Prior to this event, Hiroshima city was unknown to many outside of Japan.  Since then, the city and its surviving residents have become a symbol for world peace and a message against nuclear weapons.  \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn today’s Japan, the memory of the atomic bomb has faded in a world where economic growth and computer technology have helped a previously war-torn nation prosper. In fact, Japan has renewed its society, people, and economy, attaining the second largest economy in the world. My generation is proud of participating in this rebuilding of Japan.  However, together with power and economic strength should come responsibility and promotion of world peace. Therefore, more important is our responsibility towards future generations.  We must act as messengers against war and nuclear weapons, spreading the word of our tragic experiences sixty years ago.  \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSEARCH FOR THE TRUTH\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA few days ago, I celebrated my 73rd birthday in Eugene, Oregon, USA, where my son resides and where my husband and I have retired.  My two darling grandchildren, Paul (8 years old) and Sarah (7 years old), brought me a birthday cake that they had purchased with their own little savings.  Their idea was to give the “best gift” to their grandmother.  On top of the cake was written and decorated, “Happy Birthday, Our Dear Grandma” together with pink and white flowers.  On my birthday card they wrote, “My perfect grandma” and “the best grandma anyone could ever have”. My other grandson, Jonathan (7 years old), from New York wrote, “We love you and may you have many more birthdays to come”. To me, the innocence and purity of these messages represent the beautiful bond of love and respect in any human relationship.  The cake and cards were not simply gifts, but also symbols of love and hope.  I wish and pray that coming generations can achieve world peace and make an even better world, so that all children’s great potentials can be both developed and realized.  \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn retrospect, my life has been a long journey of experiences that has shaped and made the person that I am today.  Indeed, I have been fortunate enough to have lived this long and to have had the opportunity to receive overwhelming affection and joy from my three grandchildren. My life has truly been blessed, meaningful and gratifying.  But I believe that each person has a purpose in life.  Why did I survive the atomic bomb and war when thousands of my countrymen perished? Was I just lucky?  No, I believe that with my survival comes a responsibility.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI would like to share my experiences of the war.  \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHiroshima city is my dear hometown. It is a beautiful city surrounded by hills, mountains and seven rivers. It was where I was born, went to school, and grew up.  During my childhood, Hiroshima represented to me the safety of home, a city that offered a great part of my happiness in life. I had the happiest childhood any one could ask for. Although I knew Japan was at war, I felt safe and unaffected in Hiroshima, together with my friends and family.  Then one day all of that changed.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was in Hiroshima on that fateful day, August 6, 1945, when the atomic bomb was dropped. This day was the most important day in my life. It represented my saddest, most heart-broken day. At the same time, it also represented a miracle.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n I was only l3 years old.  On Sunday, August 5, my family went to the outskirts of Hiroshima for a picnic. I had a wonderful day playing and swimming with my cousins and family. The next day, Monday morning, a fatal day, I was so tired and exhausted I just simply could not get out of bed to go to school. Even my childhood friend, Tae-chan, came by to my bedroom and asked me to go to school together.  It was so strange; my body felt so tired and heavy that I simply could not get up.  That day I stayed home.  This marked the first day of absence in my entire school life.   My poor Tae-chan went to school without me.  One hour later, at 8:15 in the morning, the atomic bomb was dropped in the center of Hiroshima city where my school was located.  On that day, the majority of students who went to school never returned home. Their innocent and precious lives were taken away from them unfairly and abruptly.  Those few who were able to survive, albeit momentarily, soon succumbed to the devastating effects of radiation.  I lost all my classmates who went to the school that fateful day.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy dear friend Tae-chan was one of the few who survived, but was barely able to make it home. Her whole body was badly burned and her eyes were swollen shut.  She collapsed in front of her house gate. Despite heroic efforts to save her life, she passed away one hour later in the arms of her loving parents. The memory of her stopping by my house that morning is forever burned in my memory. Imagine, she was worried about my health that morning, and now she was dead.  I was devastated. The bomb took her life away without reason.  As a matter of one-hour difference, Tae-chan and I were separated from each other by death and life.  She was only 12 years old.  Tae-chan was my best friend. I was a “city girl” at heart, but Tae-chan loved nature. She taught me how to climb mountains, gather firewood, collect edible wild plants, catch fireflies, i.e. how to enjoy and appreciate the beauty and wonders of nature. We enjoyed being outside together, acquiring a sense of tranquility and harmony in life.  My childhood was filled with happiness and joy, in part due to Tae-chan’s friendship. Tae-chan is one of my dearest friends whom I will not and cannot forget.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAnother one of my dearest friends and classmates, Masako-san, was also killed by the atomic bomb. A few weeks after her death, her mother came to visit me and shared the last moments of her life.  Similar to Tae-chan, Masako-san was also badly burned and barely able to return home where her mother was anxiously waiting.  Although she was severely injured, her mind was clear.  She was able to ask her mother if I was okay, because she did not see me at school that day.  Just a few days before the bomb was dropped, I had stopped by her house to give her two summer peaches.  Because of the war, such delicacies were rare and I still remember Masako-san’s face, grinning ear to ear, as if I had given her two precious jewels.  On her deathbed, she asked her mother for the peaches I had given her.  She took one bite of the peach and said, “Ah, oishii” (delicious).  It was her last word.  \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nTo this day, I have kept Tae-chan’s and Masako-san’s friendships close to my heart.  As a survivor of such senseless destruction, I have felt a strong responsibility to make sure my friends did not die in vain.  These experiences have influenced me to look forward in a positive light, giving me strength and determination to achieve my resolve. \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSince then, I have dedicated and committed my life towards world peace.  I have spoken on many occasions in both the United States and Asia on the topic of “Hiroshima and Peace”.  I have shared my experiences about the atomic bomb and war. Every time I tell my story, I have not been able to control my emotions or tears.  It was a time of great tragedy in our history.  Overnight Hiroshima city was transformed from a beautiful city to a dark, empty, lonely graveyard. Beloved friends and family members were lost, many of them innocent children, women and elderly.  It was a heart-breaking experience for a thirteen-year-old girl.  I still miss my friends Tae-chan and Masako-san dearly.  I become sad when I think about how their precious lives were taken away from them without any mercy.  I think of them often and my heart aches bitterly for them.  “Farewell, my dear friends and classmates.  I promise your deaths will not be in vain.”  The senseless deaths of my friends and thousands of others should represent a powerful message against war and a foundation for the building of world peace.  Today, Hiroshima city has transformed from a symbol of war tragedy into a proud symbol of hope and world peace.  \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLooking back at my life, I see a long journey leading to where I am today.  After my experiences of the war, I went though a long period of soul searching for the truth.  My mission school Jogakuin and family education provided me with an answer to my search: God has a special mission for my life.  It was not a mere coincidence that I was absent from school the day the atomic bomb fell.  I was alive because I had a special purpose in life. My strong desire was to become a social worker and peace worker.  I wanted to help the less fortunate and to spread the word of peace.  As a result, I have spent most of my career life as a social work and educator, promoting the importance of peace and harmony in various countries such as the Philippines, Japan, Korea and the United States. \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI cannot stress enough the importance of education in my life, for through its encouraging and supportive environment I was able to grow both mentally and spiritually. The foundation for my education started with my Christian schooling at Hiroshima Jogakuin.  I attended Jogakuin for a period of ten years, from junior high school through undergraduate college.  As a result of my education there, I was taught strong fundamental Christian values together with my academic curriculum. My mother and two sisters are also graduates of the same school.  My family was the “Jogakuin” family.  I am proud to be a product of Jogakuin, and I share this honor with many other outstanding graduates who have become selfless contributing members of society due to the special and privileged education we received.  Even before I graduated from college I knew I wanted to further my education abroad.  I trusted God that He would help me achieve my purpose in life. This opportunity came sooner than I expected.  Through will, determination, faith and God’s guiding hand, I was able to pursue a higher education in the United States with support of scholarships provided by Hiroshima Jogakuin, University of Wisconsin, and PEO Sisterhood scholarship organization. The importance of woman’s development and contribution to society was always reaffirmed by my strong Christian faith and my promise to my friends and classmates.  Everyday I have tried to remember my journey and goal.  Even though my life represents a small scale compared to the rest of the world, I stand and speak for world peace and harmony.  I stand for, “No more Hiroshima.” <br />\n\t\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nCONCLUSION\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe 20th century imparted numerous unforgettable lessons to my generation, both tragic and favorable.  We learned from our teachers and history books about World War I, but experienced first hand the harsh reality of World War II.  In this war Japan was an offending aggressor, but the majority of her citizens were the unfortunate victims and “casualties of war”.  We suffered the incessant bombing raids day and night, which ultimately culminated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki before the end of that terrifying war.  Although there remain many controversies over the use of the atomic bomb and nuclear warfare, this act is considered by many as not only dire cruelty but also an act against humanity. This legacy of war should be forever remembered not only by our generation but also by all future generations, in Japan and the rest of the world.  \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nJapan’s history teaches us how important it is to reflect on and learn from the past and to take a positive posture in redeeming and working earnestly toward the enhancement and well being of a harmonious world community.    War is a terrible experience to any generation.  Even one human life is too valuable to lose.  We must work together as citizens of the world. We must rise above our own selfish interests to ensure a safer environment and world peace for our children, grandchildren and all future generations.  These issues represent the challenge and agenda for generations to come so that history will not repeat such human-made misery and destruction brought on by war. Today peace bells ring high and loud from the city of Hiroshima for world peace.</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

Now the village is named Numata-cho in Asa-minami-ku.  The straight distance from the hypocenter to the village is approximately 12 or 13 kilometers.  It is one of the areas of the black rainfall.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNormally, August is the month of summer vacation, but in 1945 we had school even in the hottest month, because at the near end of the wartime, Hiroshima city was attacked by B-29 airplanes almost every day.  Air-raid alarms were often heard.  Therefore to take refuge from the air-raid areas, many school children were evacuated from the city to the countryside.  They were evacuated in a group or some were sent to their relatives in remote areas.  Our village was no exception and received evacuated people.  Many school children were sent to our village, and they stayed in the temple, which could accommodate many of them.  But school buildings could not accommodate them all.  So we had to share the classrooms by attending only half a day, divided into the morning class and the afternoon class.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn that day, the morning of August 6, 1945, I was doing my homework at home, as I was to attend the afternoon class.  It was a very fine day, with the bright sunshine.  At that moment, 8:15, a sudden gleam of light flashed and the surroundings became nothing but white.  I could see nothing around me.  I was overcome with terror.  I was so afraid that I tried to find my mother, who was outside the house.  When I went to the kitchen, a strong blast made the whole house shakes.  And the ash under the cooking stove flew up in all directions.  The distance from the center of the explosion was so far away, but the blast was enormous!  I rushed out of the house!  There, I found the huge orange-colored clouds rising in the shape of a gigantic mushroom above the mountain!  It was rising higher and higher, becoming bigger and bigger.  What on earth is it?  What has happened?  We had no way of finding what it was.  Under the clouds tens of thousands of people were burned to death and torn up to pieces at that moment with a single bomb!  Besides, we did not know the terrible effects of intensive radiation that to which the people in the whole city and the neighboring towns were exposed.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter a while, something like burned cloth or blackened cotton pieces flew over the mountains and reached our village.  They were the things blown up by the bombing.  Seeing the orange mushroom-shaped clouds and the unusual blowing things, I knew something horrible had happened. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBefore long, the black rain poured down all over us.  At that time of the season, the green rice fields were filled with clean fresh water, but the water became black very soon.  It was the radioactive rain.  As I had no idea that it was contaminated rain, I scooped it up with my hands.  It was so black that I instinctively felt it was dangerous and I went into the house.  I went back to the room where I was sitting and found the window was broken by the shock of the blast and the glass was broken to pieces and fell all over my zabuton (cushion)!  If I had not left the place at the moment of the flash and blast, I would have been hurt by the pieces of glass!  The mere thought of it even now makes me shudder.  But fortunately I had no injury at all. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nTowards the evening, many sufferers from the bomb were carried back from the city by carts and wagons.  Among them, there was one of our neighbor’s sons brought back on a cart.  He was a high-school boy who was commuting to school in Hiroshima city.  He was burned all over.  His lips were swollen.  As he looked completely different, I couldn’t identify him at first.  Several days later he died.  He was the first victim I saw in the neighborhood.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI have two sisters and a brother.  My eldest sister was in Ujina, south of ground zero and was exposed to radiation.  She was carrying out her duty as a member of women’s Volunteer Service Corps, suppoting the army in Ujina.  The other sister was working at a munitions company in Gion, and she also suffered from the bombing.  My brother was in Kagoshima in Kyushu as a soldier of the special attack corps.  Only mother and I were at home.  So during the war my family members were all separated to work for our country.  But we were fortunate enough to survive the war, and we could get together again after the war. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt that time I was 10 years old, in the fourth grade of grade school.  Since then 60 years have passed away.  But the strong flash, the violent blow, the vivid orange-colored mushroom clouds, the radioactive black rain, the horrible appearance of the victim, all of them, how could I forget!</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe war ended 60 years ago, but the fear of war has not yet been removed from my minds.  As a victim of the Hiroshima tragedy, I sincerely pray it never happens again.  Atomic bombs should never be used or tested again on the human beings of the whole world.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n…70 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

We, the fifth grade students, were on the second floor of the new school building.  I was standing alone, holding a bucket and rag, when I heard the roar of a B-29 out of the window.  When I looked up at the sky, a bright flash pierced my eyes.  I ran out of the classroom towards the stairs.  There was a large boom, and I fell to the floor of the hallway, covering my eyes and ears.  When I came to my senses, I was for some reason crouched inside of the class podium.  I imagine the podium was blown out to the hallway by the blast and somehow I fit right into it.  But having no recollection at the time, I believed that God had placed it over me.  I waited for the dust to settle and took one step.  A sharp piece of glass pierced the bottom of my foot.  I can still clearly recall the feeling of glass entering my skin.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI ran ferociously out to the schoolyard.  I saw my crying classmates, teachers, and soldiers (they were living in the old school building).  The students who suffered serious injuries were put on boards and carried away.  Strangely, I could not cry.  I had some light injuries on my head (even now, my left eye, teeth, cheek, leg and pinky finger are distorted slightly.  I have been hard of hearing since then and also not very smart.)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe took shelter in a bamboo forest when the black rain fell.  We came to a gathering spot in Gion.  I saw countless numbers of people whose skin hung from their fingertips and clothes were torn to shreds.  They all walked in a line as if it were a parade of the dead.  I met my classmate’s father from Mitaki and he led me along the mountain range and took me home.  It was evening when I arrived.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy brother, a first grader, was at the Nakahara meeting hall in Mitaki-cho and was cut all over his body by shattered glass.  As if that wasn’t bad enough, he stood in the black rain to wash off his body (which is probably why his health suffered in his twenties all the way to his death at 49).  My family used to live in Zaimoku-cho and if we hadn’t moved to Mitaki, due to having our home dismantled, we probably would have all been dead.  My youngest brother, who was 2 years old, suffered burns on his head and throat.  At the time of the blast, he was deep in the valley but was in an area that got lots of sun.  He died on September second.  My father couldn’t move for a year due to the burns he suffered on over half of his body.  It was my job to pick off the larva that grew in his wounds.  On fine days I was busy going into the mountain to gather some kindling or grass (to feed our rabbits and goats, as well as ourselves).  I don’t remember exactly when school started again.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy home was crowded from the day of the bombing with strangers, acquaintances, and relatives.  It was as if we were hosting a refugee camp.  Even a horse ran to our house and died on arrival.  Despite his burns and having gone into the city to search for people, my father had been traumatized and we were unable to leave our house for a while.  We watched the sea of fire for three days and three nights from the mountains of Mitaki.  I remember going to Yokogawa Station to get some ration of rice balls and yomogi (mugwort) flavored mochi. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy Thoughts</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI felt young until 60, started feeling my age at around 65, and at 70 began to wonder if death was near.  I received an inquiry from RCC (radio station) for the approaching 60th anniversary of the atomic bomb, and I have been helping them find the bomb survivors from the Oshiba Grade School.  I agreed to being recorded for the video “The Stories of the A-bomb Survivors” (created by Hiroshima Peace and Culture Center Foundation) in March of 2002.  As it said in the interview published in the Chugoku Newspaper, I have been troubled with survivor’s guilt since a young age and didn’t really want to recall and recreate the picture of hell through my storytelling.  When I was reaching 20 and celebrating my coming of age and getting ready for marriage, I was told to keep it a secret that I was an A-bomb survivor.  Although we cannot say for sure, it is possible that my children’s health suffered because I had been in the bombing.  I do not blame my husband’s parents for objecting to our marriage.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI believe that it is possible that the children of survivors suffer psychologically and mentally.  The effects the mother has on the unborn baby, as well as what we pass on through genetics, is still very mysterious.  I have been studying the human body for over 30 years and know that there are many unknowns in the medical field and things that cannot be detected by X-rays and tests.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhile we spend our days and years over foolish wars, our planet is gradually headed towards destruction.  I believe we all feel a sense of urgency.  The atomic bomb, that has been nicknamed “Pika-Don ” has many different effects on people’s bodies depending on how people receive and understand it.  For me, the “Pika” had a white-gold color.  But later, when I had flash-backs during an anniversary of the bomb, the “Pika” came to me in red, and then a second time it was a pitch-black “Don.”  These flashbacks were different from the actual experience, for I had lost consciousness at “Don” and regained consciousness some time later in the darkness.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I entered Hiroshima Jogakuin Junior High School, I met two people from the Nakajima Grade School that I had attended before I transferred to Oshiba Grade School.  One student said they had no recollection of the bombing, and we graduated before I ever got a chance to speak to the other student.  If they are alive today, they may feel like speaking of their past.  Today I value the time I have left and am living life looking for ways that I can be of service so that I will not have any regrets.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n(I kept the descriptions of the bomb experience simple since I was unable to give a testimonial without becoming too emotional.)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n…70 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

Television, radio, and newspapers are reporting the catastrophic disasters caused by the earthquake six miles under the ocean, which caused more than </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n210,000 lost lives and destruction beyond imagination. Lines and lines of dead bodies spread on the ground, and people desperate to find their lost ones. This news brought back vivid memories of August 6,1945, when I was seven years old. Everyone remembers that historic day when the first A-bomb was dropped over Hiroshima，my home town. Many people were killed, burned，and hurt. Many houses were destroyed. Parents lost their children, and children their parents.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy parents owned a kitchen equipment store in Yokogawa. My parents, next oldest sister, Yoshiko, and I lived on the second floor of the store. My second oldest sister, Toshiko, lived in the main house in Uchikoshi-cho, which is between the store and a shelter house that was completed the day before the bomb was dropped. The shelter house was at the foot of a hill in a bamboo grove, and in front of it the Ota River was running. It was 2 km(1.2 miles) away from the bomb’s hypocenter. My oldest sister, Reiko, was in Tokyo studying at medical school, and my third oldest sister, Sachiko, was sent to the country with her schoolmates. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe night before the bomb, mother insisted that we move to the shelter house. She took Yoshiko’s and my hands, and she sang funny songs on the way to the shelter house. She let me carry money in a box, which made me happy. Father stayed at his store. The next morning we got up early. We gathered up wood shavings and cleaned up the mess the carpenters left. We started a fire to burn this trash. Yoshiko and I were fighting over who would use the bathroom first in the new house. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat morning we did not want to go to school. We played hookey and stayed home. Our Misasa Grade School building was occupied by soldiers, so we studied at our neighbor’s house. I do not remember hearing airplanes, warning sirens, a loud explosive sound, or seeing any flashing light or mushroom cloud. All I remember is, I was blown some distance from where I was into a barley field, and felt like I was wrapped in a yellowish, smelly veil. I called for mother. “ Mother, mother, where are you? ” “ Sister, where are you?” We found each other. My neck felt as if it had been hit by a cannon ball. Hot! So hot ! We three stepped in the river to soothe our wounds. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nRealizing we were hurt, mother decided to take us to Misasa Grade School, which was supposed to be an emergency treatment center. We started to walk the narrow street toward the school. Houses along the street had fallen down. People were crying out for help because they were pinned under the fallen houses. “ Help, help me !” they cried. We did not feel like helping anyone. We must have been in shock. We passed by the main house where Toshiko lived, and that house was down flat. We made a casual remark, “ Poor Toshiko, she must be dead !” </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFirst we thought the enemy had dropped the bomb directly over the fire we had started, but as we walked we were amazed at the wide area of destruction. What kind of bomb did they drop to cause such destruction, we wondered?  Soon houses started to burn all around us. Sensing the danger, mother decided to turn back to the shelter house. As we walked back we saw many people walking aimlessly like zombies. They did not know what had happened, what to do, or where to go. Some had no hair or clothes. Their bodies were cut and bloody, burned and swollen. Some had their skin hanging down. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLines and lines of bodies were lying along the road near the river, and they were lying with both of their arms raised and their eyes wide open. Big eyes and raised arms looked strange and weird to me. People were begging for water. “Water, water, please give me water!” Returning to the shelter house, we found Father and Toshiko there. Toshiko’s beautiful face was covered with blood. She had heard the plane and was outside with a Japanese fan between the main house and a storage shed watching the plane. Since she was outside she was saved, because the house was flattened. Father’s head, face, neck, and arm were burned. He was supposed to have been down in the city that morning, close to where the bomb was dropped, to train students in civil defense. Because one of his bike tires was flat that morning, he was delayed in leaving for his duties downtown and was outside having the tire fixed. Because of this, his life was saved. It is God’s grace that none of my family perished that day.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHalf of the shelter house was downed by the blast, showing long nails hanging from the beams. The neighbor’s house, next door to the shelter house, started to burn. People put out the fire by passing bucketsful of water from the river. Soon afterward black rain started to fall. “Our enemy must be pouring gasoline over us. They are going to light it to make sure none of us would survive,” we thought. The sun was extraordinarily huge and bright crimson red that morning. So impressive! People were asking if we had seen such and such boys and girls.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLater, I found I could not move my feet and walk. Our country friend came and took us to our aunt’s house in Midorii, a couple of town away. This friend carried me on his back all the way. On the way there we received a rice ball from someone as nourishment. I had blisters on both of my arms, neck, thigh, and leg. A country doctor looked at the wounded survivors and gave a quick treatment. I don’t remember whether or not the doctor cut the blisters, drained the water, put on some medicine, and wrapped the burns. We stayed at our aunt’s house for ten days, and then went back to the shelter house.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI cleaned the burn with boiled water every day. Still, some days I saw maggots on my foot. It took twelve weeks for the burns to heal. I let no one touch my burns. God has graciously wiped away the memory of the severe pain and the ordeal to keep the burned areas clean. Mother and sisters told me how painfully I cried each time I cleaned the burned spots. I am amazed that God healed the burn in three months without medical aids and without getting infected. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nPhysical wounds get healed, but psychological wounds take a much longer time to heal. Every time Don, my husband, would ask me to peel off his sunburned skin, I felt like throwing up. It must have stirred up hidden memories of the pain I felt in cleaning the burns. Also, each time I would hear the sirens of fire engines or ambulances I would jump. Even though I don’t remember hearing sirens before the bomb was dropped, I must have heard them. I had a hard time eating fish cooked on a hibachi, since many days dead bodies were being cremated close to the shelter house. Stench from that stayed with me for a long time.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI tried to hide the A-bomb experience deep in my mind. I wanted to forget it. I did not want to tell the story to anyone. Being a survivor was like being branded “undesirable” and “no good.” “Is there anyone who would like to marry me? Isn’t it easier to die than keep living?” I wondered. One day my sister, Sachiko, said, “Etsu-chan, some day you will be happy you had this A-bomb experience.” “Never! How could that be? Happy? No way!”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThis is the 60th anniversary of the A-bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Not too many survivors are left. It’s all right to talk about the bitter experience so that the same mistakes won’t be repeated, but if we dwell on the miserable experience of the past and try to blame a people or nation, it’s not all right with me. I don’t want any part of using this bitter experience against any one or any country. People suffer unfairly in different ways―sickness and disease, loss of loved ones, divorce, financial loss, broken relationships, etc. To each one, suffering is as real and painful as what I went through. Do we blame God or others? No! Big no! </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI have experienced other pains and sufferings in my life―my left kidney was removed because of malfunction, we lost our only daughter with breast cancer, our son became divorced, etc. Any kind of suffering, man-made or natural, is painful. But, to those who love God, we can see his loving hands at work, his mercy and grace turning bitter experiences into sweet ones for our good. In Romans 8:28 (NLT) of the Bible it says, “And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nGod allowed me to live long enough to see this promise fulfilled in my life. It is a long story to tell, but I see his goodness and mercy throughout my life, for which I am greatly thankful. One of my greatest concerns about being a survivor was in being able to get married and have a family, but God blessed me in this. During the summer of 1958, while I was in my sophomore year at Hiroshima Jogakuin, I was invited to attend a 2-week seminar in Kobe involving college students from many nations. This seminar was sponsored by the AFSC (American Friends Service Committee) and the theme of the seminar was “If you don’t want war, prepare for peace.” Because of my A-bomb experience, Mac Sensei, (Ms. Mary McMillan) and my mother encouraged me to participate. Mac Sensei, who was my dear teacher and counselor, said, “Maybe you can help others to understand the suffering and pain caused by wars.” So I applied for the seminar, but felt heavy in my heart because I didn’t have confidence in my ability to speak English for the two-week period of the seminar. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere at the seminar I met Don. We fell in love “at first sight”, but I went on to complete college and he returned to America. In July 1960, soon after graduating from Hiroshima Jogakuin, I flew to the United States, and Don and I were married in Pasadena, California, where Don was living at the time. We have now been married for 44 years and been blessed with 3 children and 8 grandchildren. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI am thankful for the blessings God has granted me to enjoy my life with a family of my own, and for warm-hearted and loving friends here in America and in Japan. I am also thankful for freedom to be myself, for this beautiful country, for opportunities to study the Bible at church and other places and getting to know Jesus more personally, for fellowship with deeply committed Christians, for strength and energy to live every day, and for assurance I have of eternal life with Jesus. His ways and thoughts are much greater than ours. He is the creator of everything. He is the ruler of the universe. He is love. He knows what is best for each of us. He disciplines those whom he loves, and he wants to have a relationship with each of us. When we believe in Jesus for what he did for us, dying on the cross to pay the ransom for our sin, we can come boldly to the throne of God as his sons and daughters, and have relationships with him both here on earth and in heaven.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI believe peace and security will come only from God. As long as man has evil desires within, war rages. We covet what others have―power, money, fame, etc.---and when we can’t get it we fight. When we learn to trust and obey Jesus we will be content. When he comes back to this earth to establish his kingdom, then, and only then, will everlasting peace be obtained. Come Jesus, come. I thank God for Hiroshima Jogakuin for introducing Christ to me, and for shaping my life.   \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n…68 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">60 years ago</p><p class=\"body_en\">I entered elementary school in April 1945.  Soon after I started going to school, it was decided that students should be sent to the countryside for evacuation from air raids.  In those days, my family consisted of my father, mother, brother (a college student), four older sisters (two middle school students, a sixth grader and a fourth grader), myself (a first grader), my first little sister (three years old), and my second little sister (eleven months old).  With three primary school children, including myself, and still smaller ones in the family, my parents decided to send my mother and the children not yet in middle school to stay outside of Hiroshima.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy brother was drafted in the spring of 1945.  Around that time, joining the army meant that you had to be prepared to die in the war and to never come back home.  So we took the family photo before my brother left home, which has become the only picture of all of my family members together, because two of my sisters were killed by the A-bomb on the 6 of August, 1945.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAround the end of July, the school in the countryside where we had moved closed for the busy farming season.  As my mother was worried about our house in Hiroshima, and also she needed to visit her relative in the sickbed, we temporarily came back home.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was a clear morning on the 6 of August.  The sun was glaring.  My father had gone to Okayama on his business trip.  He was supposed to be back in Hiroshima before August 6, but he missed the train and was still in Okayama.  My mother took my baby sister, Toshiko, to visit her sick relative in Itsukaichi-cho on the outskirts of the city.  When she was leaving home, my fourth sister, Michiko, asked my mother to take her also, but my mother did not allow her to come.  Later my mother had to regret it forever, saying in tears, “I should have taken Michiko also.  I still remember her on the street in front of the house standing to see me off for a long time.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy brother was sent to the army camp in Yamaguchi prefecture.  My second sister, Hideko, was at home together with my fifth sister, Katsuko (My first sister had already died of an illness.)  Usually, she went every day to work at a factory, because at that time students began being mobilized to munitions factories instead of attending school.  But on that day, she was on a monthly holiday, and was hanging the washing on the line of the balcony.  My third sister, Hiroko, was in the Tsurumi district of the city together with her schoolmates, mobilized to demolish the houses to make a huge fire lane that would divide the city into north and south.  It was to protect important institutions from possible fire caused by the bombing.  My fourth sister, Michiko, had gone off on her bicycle to get ice for our home refrigerator.  After my mother left home, I took my immediate little sister, Fumie, to visit our uncle (the brother of my father) in the neighborhood.  By eighth sister, Toshiko, was at the Koi Station with my mother on their way to Itsukaichi.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy sister, Fumie, and I were at our uncle’s house after the air raid alert was all cleared that morning.  The house surrounding the courtyard was airy and very comfortable.  My aunt was cleaning the study whose windows faced to the east and the south.  She played a record for children and we were listening to the music.  There were two sturdy wooden desks, two chairs and a bookshelf on the south side of the room.  It was then that I saw a plane flying over the sky, and realized that it was a B-29 plane.  “It’s a B-29 plane!” I shouted and climbed onto the windowpane to see the plane better.  My cousin followed me to the window.  So I moved a little to the west side on the windowpane.  As we were looking at the plane together, it dropped the A-bomb, which exploded 600 meters above the ground in the air.  The house where we were was 1.3 kilometers from ground zero.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I came back to my senses, I found myself lying on the dirt ground under the window, inside the house.  My cousin was lying there, too.  My aunt and sister, Fumie, who had been in the same room, were blown farther to the entrance area of the house and my aunt was about to rise herself.  The desks, two chairs, a bookshelf, tatami-mats and everything else in the room were all blown away and gone.  The house was new and escaped from collapsing, but many old houses in the neighborhood were crushed.  The fire had not started at that time.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe stepped outside.  We saw an old woman crying for help, trapped under stonewalls.  The daughter of the woman and we tried to help her out, but the wall was too heavy for us to lift.  Trying to take us three children with her, my aunt went to the underground shelter to look for a rope for tying them on her back.  I waited for her to come back, but became terrified to see the house beginning to catch fire and flames raging out of the windows.  Unable to wait for her any longer, I ran away by myself.  My sister shouted to ask me to stay there but I couldn’t hear anything with fear.  I stepped on the roofs of collapsed houses toward the riverbank.  Seeing other people fleeing in the direction of the mountain, I followed them.  After I crossed a wooden bridge called Nakahirobashi and came near the bamboo bush on the riverbank, the very bridge I had just crossed caught on fire from both its ends.  Since grown up people were crossing the river on foot, I tried to follow them, but the river was too deep for me.  A kind woman carried me by her side and crossed the river.  Seeing that she had some cucumbers, I thought of using them to heel the burns on my face and arms.  Remembering the cucumber tells me that I already knew that I had been burned.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWalking toward the mountain, I came across two of my relatives; my father’s brother-in-law and the father of my aunt.  They were on their way to our house, worried about our family.  When I identified myself to them, my uncle carried me on his back to an emergency clinic to sterilize and bandage the injuries on my face and arms, and took me back to his home, which was where my mother had been heading on the morning of that day.  I was so relieved to be on his back, and did not remember anything before I got to his house.  At his house I was able to meet my mother.  She was so happy to see me and said “At least Junko is alive.” My father’s brother-in-law drew a large two-wheeled cart and headed back to Hiroshima to look for the other members of our family.  Some time later, he brought back my aunt and cousin, and my sisters on the cart.  My immediate elder sister, Katsuko, who was at home then, was heavily injured.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen my father arrived in Hiroshima from Okayama, the whole city had been destroyed.  He ran around in the ruined city for a few days looking for his family.  Hearing from someone that we had gone to Itsukaichi, he came and reunited with us.  Later he said that when he was searching for us, suddenly a man rose and asked him, “Water, please give me some water….” He was so astonished because he thought that the man was already dead.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHe later heard that Hiroko, my older sister, was injured and brought to a school.  When he reached the school, all the classrooms were filled with injured people lying on the floor.  My father looked for my sister from room to room, calling her name.  After a few days of searching he was about to give up, when he heard a faint voice at his foot, “Daddy.” Hiroko looked so different with her injuries.  My father laid her on the board and put her on his bicycle, covering her with a white cloth to avoid the scorching sun.  Looking at them, some people joined their hands and murmured in Buddhist prayer, believing she was already dead.  Hiroko was offended to hear their prayer and said, “I’m not dead yet!”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen she was brought to our relative’s house, she was able to say in a loud voice, “I am home!” which made all of us so glad and relieved.  She was carried to the bed quilt in a tatami room, but there was virtually no treatment we were able to give her.  At the moment of the flash, she was crouching down and trying to adjust her shoestrings.  In those days, even during summer, schoolgirls were wearing black uniforms (to avoid being spotted by enemy airplanes), which absorbed the intense heat rays of the bomb and burned her back more heavily.  Soon many maggots bred on her back injuries.  Picking them off from her back was about all we could do for her, but there were so many of them and as we picked one off, others would crawl deeper into her flesh, which caused her great pain.  She often cried and said, “Stop it now, it hurts so much.”  The smell of her rotten flesh filled the room and her clothes would become dirty quickly.  And cousins of my mother kindly brought some change of clothes, which my mother would remember for a long time in gratitude.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMilitary planes still flew over Hiroshima often and scared us all.  My sisters with heavy injuries on their feet and backs were so scared as they were not able to move.  My mother made a pile of bedding mattresses around them to ease their fear and told them, “Don’t worry.  I will not leave you alone.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI clearly remember the day when the war ended on August 15.  The adults listening to the broken voice of the Emperor on the radio started to cry loudly.  But as a small child, I felt relieved, for there would be no more bombs dropped on us.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the next morning, August 16, my second sister, Hiroko, called my mother from her sickbed when we having breakfast, saying, “Mom, could you come here for a second?” My mother told her to wait for a moment.  A little later she went to see Hiroko.  With the voice of my mother crying,“Hiroko! Hiroko!” we rushed to her bedside, but she was already dead.  Despite the joy she gave us when she came back home, she died, without being able to receive any treatment worthy of the name.  Her burns were due to intense heat from the bomb rays which was absorbed in her black uniform.  And she stayed in the radioactive environment for a long time.  So I believe that the cause of her death was not only the burns but also the effect of the radiation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter the war ended and Hiroko died, my family moved to the countryside again.  Some people in the area blamed us for being A-bombed, saying that it was a punishment from heaven for leading a luxurious life in the city.  We stayed there for some time, but it was hard for us from the city to live in that community.  We decided to go back to the ruined Hiroshima.  Father and my brother, who had been demobilized and were back from Yamaguchi, had built a shabby hut with boards and plates they collected, putting a tin roof over it.  There was one 6-mat tatami room and an earth floor kitchen with a hand pump to get ground water.  The shabby hut had neither electricity, nor water, and the roof was leaky.  We mad a bath outside of that house and we had to take a bath only after dark.  But we were happier together there than in the countryside.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLet me tell you a little more about myself.  I was saved by my uncle who carried me to his house in Itsukaichi, but the burns on the entire part of my face, right arm and neck took a very long time to heal.  My mother was worried that I might lose sight of my right eye, which kept oozing pus.  On the day of the bombing, I was wearing a simple white dress, which I believe protected my body.  I was on the windowpane to see the plane in the sky, and the bomb’s heat rays burned my face, neck and my right hand and arm, which held the window frame.  These injuries of mine and the big cut on my sister’s thigh did not heal easily.  The sore parts kept oozing liquid and new skin would not develop.  Hearing that it was a good medicine, my father brought a semi-transparent ointment in a small container.  He handed it to me, saying, “Use this little by little, as it is a very expensive medicine.” That ointment worked miraculously well on me.  My mother and sisters always took great care to apply the medicine to my face.  But the keloid on my hand and neck remained a long time.  I always covered that part of my body with clothes and hated to wear short-sleeves or swimsuits in the summer.  A doctor once told me that if you expose the wound to the air, the reconstruction of that part would be accelerated.  That may explain the speedy recovery of the burns on my face.  Covering my neck and hand could have prolonged their recovery.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe house of my mother’s parents was close to the blast center.  My mother collected the ashes found in the kitchen, and the ashes of a body clutching the handled of a chest of drawers, assuming that they were the remains of her parents.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy father’s younger brother was in my father’s company office, meeting a guest.  Though we hoped he had escaped, his body was later found there on the chair.  Flames might have engulfed him while he was unable to move.  The guest he was meeting on that day visited us later to describe the situation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy fourth sister, Michiko, who had gone to get ice, is still missing.  My parents looked everywhere and found that she did visit the ice shop, but her whereabouts were unknown after that.  Every year, they searched for her name on the annually revised list of the A-bomb deceased, but could not find her.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThanks to the passage of time, the keoidal skin on my hand and neck has almost recovered, with that part of the skin getting thinner and the scar of the burns indistinctive.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt is hard for me to revisit and recount my experience, but nuclear weapons are still threatening our lives, and they can be used at any time.  The human race has the highest intelligence on this planet, using letters and languages.  Humans are supposed to be able of feel love and sorrow and the pain of others.  But they still wage wars, and even depleted uranium weapons (though they many not be call nuclear arms) are used massively.  How foolish humans can become! But I want to believe in humanity’s wisdom.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMany of us Hibakusha do no want to tell their stories of unhealed pains in their minds and bodies.  But we must tell the world what has happened and what we have gone through.  Hibakusha are aged now and there are fewer and fewer of them who can tell you such stories of their experiences.  We Hibakusha strongly hope for a world where no one ever should experience the pains that we have experienced.  The only way to achieve it is to abolish nuclear weapons.  If we cooperate with the people all over the world, it is possible to make a peaceful world without nuclear weapons.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFinally, I would like to pray for the souls of the people who were killed by Atomic bombs and in war throughout the world.  Thank you.</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

The Baldwin Company in America made it around 1920.  Shizuko Kawamoto, the owner of this piano, silently died on March 29 this year.  She was 103.  She traveled to America alone as a young High School graduate back in the days when going abroad was still quite rare.  In 1922, she married Genkichi Kawamoto (he was 101 years old when he died in 1989) in Los Angeles.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nGenkichi, who worked in the insurance industry, loved his wife and took her on all of his business trips.  However, Shizuko was having trouble conceiving.  Genkichi bought a piano for his wife, hoping that piano lessons might ease her remorse for their infertility.  Shizuko, who worked as a grade school teacher until she got married and was feeling quite lonely in a foreign country, comforted herself by playing the piano.  When the two were finally blessed with a daughter, it was as if the angel of happiness descended upon them.   “It was worth all that waiting and anticipation,” Genkichi wrote in his diary.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n1 p.m. Tuesday May 25, 1926 </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBorn in a Japanese hospital in Los Angeles</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA baby girl, delivered by Dr. Koshino</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’ll name her Akiko, for the wisdom and intelligence I pray for her to possess.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n(From The Kawamoto’s Journal of Rearing Akiko)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nTheir address at the time was 3129 Folsow Street, Los Angeles, CA U.S.A\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe couple thought of their precious daughter as a gift from God.  They raised her with love through good times and bad.  In The Journal of Rearing Akiko, Genkichi recorded not just her weight and height, but many details describing his daughter’s growth process.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAug. 8, 1926 (Sunday) / 76 days old, we take her out for the first time.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSept. 6, 1926 / Akiko is very healthy and much to her parents’ delight, putting on weight.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMay 25, 1928 (Friday) / She is now 24 months old.  She has a vocabulary of about 150 words.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMar. 16, 1929 / Nobuhito (Akiko’s brother) returns from the hospital.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn 1933, the family moved back to Japan.  They decided to live in Shizuko’s hometown Oko for the time being and Akiko entered Hiroshima Jogakuin Grade School.  Sometimes she would commute by taxi.  She stayed until they closed the grade school.  Akiko had kept a journal every day since she arrived in Japan, until about a year before her death.  The first journal was kept in her Japanese notebook, written all in Katakana .  Genkichi recognized the value in teaching Akiko Japanese while she grew up in a foreign environment.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMay 25, 1934 / It was my birthday.  I played with Toshi-chan, Yoshikazu, and Nobuhito.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSep. 18, 1934 / I had another piano lesson today.  My piano lessons are on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSep. 19, 1934 / Starting today, I’m going to have piano lessons everyday.  Since I didn’t know, I called Grandpa and had him bring the musical scores and lunch for me.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSep. 23, 1934 / I ate lunch at the mountain Father bought.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n(From Akiko’s 1934 Journal)\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn 1935, the family built a home on the mountain in Mitaki, which is in the northwest side of Hiroshima city.  Not many homes in the city had pianos at the time, and the piano teacher commuted to their home in Mitaki.  Sometimes mother and daughter enjoyed playing four-handed pieces together.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMay 15, 1938 / I went to Ms. Hata’s at 2 p.m. for my piano lesson.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter graduating from grade school, she then took the entrance exam to Jogakuin High School.  Akiko continued to take calligraphy and piano lessons.  The journals she wrote switched from standard issue notebooks to notebooks with cute covers suitable for a budding young woman.  The contents of her entry also evolved into the various thoughts that go through the heads of girls at a sensitive age.  On the first page of her new diary in 1942, she wrote “17 years old, born May 25 1925, 65-1 Mitakiyama.” </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHowever, times were changing as the war progressed.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe Kawamoto’s started renting out rooms and extravagant birthday parties became things of the past.  Things began to change in Akiko’s world, too.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nJan. 27, 1942 / I don’t much enjoy keeping a journal anymore.  It was really warm this morning.  It was 4.8 degrees Celsius.  I learned the song “Early Spring” in music class.  I really like it.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFeb. 4, 1942 / I slept alone last night and it felt really good.  I love sleeping alone.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMar. 8, 1942 / March 10th is Nobu-chan’s birthday.  We pounded red and white bean jam mochi. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMar. 9, 1942 / Finals started today.  I hope I get a good grade.  I’m really such a score hound.  The subjects were Home Economics and Chemistry.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMay 11, 1942 / There was a reunion at school today.  Shizuko Chiba did a solo and Yasuko Okazaki played the piano.  Ms. Okazaki’s piano performance was amazing.  Her fingers moved so swiftly, lightly, and smoothly.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nJune 5, 1942 / I wrote an essay titled “Women of Tomorrow.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nJune 6, 1942 / They took some students from Jogakuin to go see Kazuko Kusama’s piano solo at 2:30 p.m.  I wanted to go so badly, but I didn’t because none of my friends would come with me.  It’s such a pity.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAug. 23, 1942 / I got into Women’s College.  I’d better have.  If I’m taking the test, I might as well pass.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAkiko was accepted into Hiroshima Jogakuin College.  But most of the time, the students ended up studying English on their own during class.  Eventually, most of their class time was spent volunteering at the Army Hospital, cultivating farm land, or training for evacuations.  Her frustration of not getting to study grew daily.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMar. 19, 1944 / Last semester I was at the top of the class and this semester it was Ms. Okamoto.  They told me that on the average I’m still at the top.  There’s something wrong.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nApr. 9, 1944 / Father encourages me to study but I’m troubled by Mother’s opposition.  If a woman’s job is to spend all day preparing food, I’m not sure why I was born.  Not being able to study is the saddest thing for me right now.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFrom 1944 and on, out of her concern for her growing brothers and Genkichi’s health, Akiko began eating less of the family’s limited food supply.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMay 3, 1945 /  They did a physical exam during 3rd period.  Height: 159.1 centimeters, Weight: 51.5 kilograms, Bust: 73 centimeters.  Compared to last year, I had gotten 0.5 centimeters taller but I weigh 1.5 kilograms less and my chest is 3.5 centimeters smaller.  It doesn’t feel right.  I’m the only one who can eat less.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe days spent in the fields increased and with that, she had less and less time to study.  Her frustration is apparent in her writings.  She directed her anger at the enemy country.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nJuly 8, 1944 /  The air raid warning siren sounded again last night.  The enemy planes did not visit the skies of Hiroshima.  I heard they attacked the northwest of Kyushu.  Those impertinent things!  We must rally our spirits.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nJuly 13, 1944 / I went to help at the citizen’s cook-off in Miyajima Island.  I ran into Oguni teacher in the train.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThis is where her entry stops.  She probably didn’t have the time or energy to continue writing during the year that followed.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nJournal entry on Jan. 1, 1944: “19 years old, 2nd year of College of Manners.  I’ve lived one-third or one-fourth of my life.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn 1945, Akiko was spending her 3rd year at Hiroshima Jogakuin College.  On August 6, she was working with the Student Mobilization, and was near Godo-chosha when the bomb was dropped.  She was thrown by the blast and, injured, walked back to her home in Mitaki.  The bridges were destroyed so she swam across Ota River.  When she finally arrived at the foot of the mountains in Mitaki, she ran out of strength and curled up on the ground.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHer mother, Shizuko, who didn’t have a way of knowing what had been happening on the other side of the river, was busy cleaning up the destruction at home.  A neighbor informed her that her “daughter is immobilized at the foot of the hill.”  Shizuko ran to her daughter and brought her home.  It seemed that she was safe for the time being but the invisible radiation had already invaded Akiko’s body.  On the 7, she passed away.  The cause of death was “Acute Radiation Damage.”  Her life was brought to a bitter end after having lived “one-third” of her life.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Mommy, I want to have some tomatoes”, were Akiko’s last words.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe tomatoes in the yard were ripe.  Until Shizuko moved to her relatives’ in Yokohama 17 years ago, every year in the summer the tomatoes in the yard bore its bright red fruit.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEven now, countless numbers of glass shards from the blast crudely stick out of the left side of the piano.  The piano wounded in the atomic bomb lost its master, who would hit the keyboard.  It quietly watched over the city of Hiroshima for 60 years.  Once in a while, the neighborhood kids would come over and play it, but the keys lost their fluidity and some lost their tune completely.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe girl and piano, both born in America, were both destroyed by the hands of their own motherland.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhat sort of piece would Akiko have wanted to play?  What sort of melody would the piano have played?\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI live near the Kawamoto’s residence in Mitaki.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI used to go and play there since I was young.  Shizuko Kawamoto was very kind to me.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI knew about Akiko and the A-Bomb piano from the many stories Shizuko told me.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe Kawamoto’s house was torn down last summer.  The wounded piano and Akiko’s relics, that Shizuko kept for 60 years, were left there: her journals, photo albums, notebooks and textbooks from her school, her essays and calligraphy.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI can’t even imagine Shizuko’s sadness and resentment.  But sadness and retaliation does not bring peace.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI had a vision for the children to revive a lasting “Melody of Peace” in the city of Hiroshima that lay across from the Ota River.  My wish came to fruition thanks to the piano tuner Mr. Sakaibara and the goodwill of people from around the world.  The piano recovered its tune.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe A-Bomb piano Peace Memorial Charity Concert was held on August 3, 2005, right before the 60th anniversary of the Atomic Bomb.  The children of Hiroshima, led by Shizuko’s great-granddaughter Rei Yamamoto (10 years old), played on the A-bomb piano.  They were beautiful messages for peace in the 21st century.</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

When she was a freshman at Hiroshima Jogakuin High School, she was in the bombing while she worked with the Student Mobilization in Zakoba-cho.  16 days later on August 22, she died at home.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn August 6th, she headed to Zakoba-cho to work with the Student Mobilization Workforce.  At 8:15, the bomb exploded and she suffered burns to all of her exposed body parts.  She was surrounded by a sea of fire.  The flames were approaching and she couldn’t escape.  She tried to stop one of her friends who jumped into the blazing fire.  The friend must have lost her mind.  It was scary, brutal and painful to wait out the fire but she managed to survive.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe next day, there was a kind man on a bicycle who asked her where her home was.  She answered “Danbara shin-machi”, and he took her half way to home.  She wasn’t sure where he let her off but she walked back the rest of the way.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe family was gone but had left a note on a sliding door saying “we’re fine and have evacuated”.  Our mother returned to the house in the evening of the 8th and found my sister.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOur mother took her to an acquaintance’s home near Taisho Bridge.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy sister had burns everywhere, over her head and her body.  It must have been painful but she didn’t complain.  There was no medicine to put on her.  I fanned her while she lay down.  Flies swarmed and larva grew in her wounds.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nShe suffered everyday.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nShe kept saying, over and over,</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“I’m sorry.  Thank you.  Let’s go to the department store together when I get well.  I’m sorry”.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHer burns seemed to be healing a little.  But her head was crushed under a stone pillar of the school’s front gate and every day she bled all over the futon, tatami and floor.  Our father walked back from Shimonoseki and came to see her.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Next time I’ll bring back some oil”, he said.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHe didn’t make it in time.  She passed away on August 22nd.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was in the first grade.  I helped our mother put my sister’s body on a cart.  We went to the riverbank and our mother burned my sister’s body.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n(This memoir was written by Teruko Marutani, in dedication to her sister Noriko Ito who was in the 57th Class of Jogakuin High School)\n</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I moved to the dorms where the students of Jogakuin lived on the second floor and the students of Kabe High School for Women on the first.  Kabe High School was a very strict public school and I was surprised to learn how stern the students were.  I used to take my leisure time and would arrive late to assembly meetings.  The House Masters would reprimand me and I remember poking fun because the House Master mistakenly called our school “Joshigakushuin”.</p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">At the factory, the students were assigned to either work with springs at the lathe, or in administration.  I was chosen to work as an administrator.  Every hour my duty was to go around the factory floor to count the machines that were working and to also keep track of productivity.  That was the first time I used a hand-cranked calculator.  The days were divided into three shifts, the first from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., the second from 4 p.m. to midnight, and the third from midnight to 8 a.m.  And we take over our duty to the next.</p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">At night, our way back to the dorms was quite dark due to the blackouts.  There was a security guard whose job was to walk us back but he often walked way ahead of us.</p>\n </p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">There were about 20 of us on our shift and we walked in rows of four.  The women from the Volunteer Service Corps walked in the front of the line, followed by the students of Kabe High School and then we were at the end.  My three roommates and I were always last in line.  Usually we would start chatting and would get distracted, only to find out that we were far behind the rest of the group.  We were afraid of the dark so we sped up our pace to catch up with the people in front of us.  <p class=\"body_en\">Then those in front of us started to pick up their pace, and then the people in front of them…  Soon the whole group was running at full speed and wondering as to what had brought it on.  The captain of the Service Corps “Stop, stop!” but nobody listened.  She was concerned because when we entered the gates at the dorms we were supposed to straighten up the lines and march to a cadence, like soldiers.  The captain yelled at the top of her lungs.  Once we entered the gate, she asked whom it was that started running.  The four of us, all out of breath, just looked at each other with an innocent look on our faces.  Every time I remember this incident I can’t help chuckling.</p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">I also remember the day when one of our teachers (I think it was Ms. Toshiko Nishida) took us to the hills behind the dorms and we sang the hymn #106.  It was only a couple days after the end of the war, and it was still taboo to sing hymns out in the open.</p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">I really meant to write about my brother who died of severe burns.  I was hoping that writing a memoir about his death would give me the opportunity to heal my grief.  But as soon as I picked up the pen, tears came out before the words and my hand trembled. I just could not bring myself to write about him.  There is much more that I want to write about but for now, I will leave it on this lighter note.</p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">… 78 years old</p>\n</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

Day in and day out, students were taken into the munitions factories to stand in front of lathes on the production line to make parts for guns.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“August 6 happened to be a day we actually attended school instead of going to the factory.  At 8:15 a.m. all of the students were gathered in the auditorium for the morning assembly.  That’s when the “Pika-Don” was dropped.  All of us were trapped under the Assembly Hall.  When I came to, I noticed that my mouth was filled with dust.  I heard some moans.  I saw the sky through the cracks of the rubble and crawled out.  But my friends, who were pinned under a large beam, couldn’t escape.  I pulled their arms to no avail.  Then the fire started.  Soldiers came and told us to flee.  They promised to save our friends.  I cried and left my friends behind and ran to Sentei Garden (Shukkeien).  Then I headed to the river behind the garden.  All the bridges across the river had collapsed so I swam across the river and escaped to a large open field.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThis was a story recounted by my classmate who died a few years ago.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was supposed to have been attending the morning assembly with her if it hadn’t been for the fact that I had been sick for a few days.  I was living in the dorm at the time, but due to my illness the school doctor had given me a note and sent me home for a week.  The “Pika-Don” was dropped while I was resting at home.  The newspaper reported that it would be decades before plants would grow on Hiroshima’s soil again.  I was in shock.  There was no way to get in touch with anybody.  There was nothing I could do and I spent the next few days in a daze.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe plot of land at Mt.Ushita, which is now the college campus grounds, used to be the school farm.  After the war in April of 1946, Jogakuin started class in the sheds, on the plot at Mt.Ushita.  The crude sheds were so small that the students from college and high school took classes in shifts every other day.  The high school dorm students moved with faculty and college students into small housing called Ushita-sanso.  We cooked our own meals on stoves in the hallway.  Food didn’t come by easily.  On our days off we went to the nearby farms to ask for potatoes and such.  Ushita-sanso stood in the woods and, unlike today, the path from the campus was a lonely, winding trail.  I was terrified of walking there alone.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe college campus today is remarkable.  I reflect on how we graduated without actually studying much because we had to work to survive.  There is an indescribable strong bond between the classmates who are still alive.  Perhaps the hardship of the war brought us closer together.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 77 years old</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I was struck by the expression “darkness of the heart.”  This darkness, in other words, was the dark secrets that you have not shared with anyone, that you have kept locked up in your heart.  It was something that I was very familiar with.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I was summoned to the Student Mobilization Workforce during the second year in Jogakuin High School.  My job was to make weapons at a car factory in the outskirts of Hiroshima.  In the beginning I used a file to finish the goods, and later I learned how to operate the large boring machine.  We were taught to protect the home front with our own hands, and fight for our country if we were the “last one standing.”  The students of those days strived under these courageous slogans.  As for me, I was just happy that we didn’t have to study.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The atomic bomb was dropped during the summer of my third year in high school, and soon the war ended.  The school burned down and many of my teachers and classmates died or disappeared.  I didn’t think about going back to school.  I spent my days in apathy, reading novels as I pleased.  The following spring, I was given the news that Jogakuin was resuming class in the building of Ushita Grade School. This was a shock to me.  \nI had forgotten all the English that I had learned as a freshman.  I didn’t know how to study on my own.  I didn’t know what to do.  I was prepared to fight to my death during the war; now they expected me to study?  I never came to terms with my lack of enthusiasm for studying.  I attended school simply to pass the time during my four and five years in high school, and then I went on to college.  I received a degree that I was unworthy of.  I took a job, hiding my poor academic ability, and got married.  At my wedding reception they introduced me in the usual fashion, “she’s very intelligent and fluent in English.”  My heart ached.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">It was after I raised my children and turned 40 years old that I finally started studying again.  If we look at 70 as the age of retirement, this means that I spent 30 years of my life trying to make up for the 2 years that I wasted in my youth.  Perhaps studying again was the only thing that could erase the darkness from my heart.  Perhaps that was the purpose of my life.  Today I spend my days attending different cultural events and enjoying myself.  This memoir was my attempt to look back on how I suffered from the aftermath of Student Mobilization.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n…74 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

The students were to fill the void of the workers sent to the battle front. Therefore, a 14 years old girl like myself was operating the machinery to make rifles.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">On August 5, the night before the dropping of the Atomic Bomb on Hiroshima, I, /with my two older sisters were watching the night sky from the window upstairs. It was so calm and stars were so beautiful that I felt as if they were showering on us. Three sisters spent time together counting the comets. We never saw so many comets before.  We were indeed blessed that evening. Yet, who knew.  The clear evening sky was an omen of a sunny morning the next day..\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">August 6 was a bright sunny morning. I arrived at the factory early, and went outdoors with friends to drink water from the faucet. It all happened at that moment.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">We were exposed to a sudden intense light, as if a giant magnesium photo flash was burned. I turned around and saw a huge fireball joined by a giant mushroom cloud. It was approaching us very fast. So we dashed into the building. No sooner than we got inside, the bomb blast cane. When the dust settled glass was shattered all over as if a tornado had hit us. We could not imagine what had happened. The factory was located a little over two miles from the Atomic Bomb epicenter, but fortunately nobody suffered visible physical injury.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">After a while we went outdoors and saw many injured people. Their clothing was torn, and they were walking past us to the countryside. Nobody knew what had happened. Since all were so badly burned we guessed, “The Americans might have dropped a new type of bomb mixed with oil.”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">We could do nothing at the factory, and our teacher instructed us to go home. We cried at a loss of what to do. Because we heard the city was totally engulfed in flames, and there was no transportation to go home. We finally formed groups by districts and decided to walk home. My home was towards the west and I decided to take the road / over the mountain.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">As we started walking home, we saw the sky over Hiroshima City stained orange by the burning flames. Fond memories of the city   suddenly vanished. Although it was almost sixty years ago, I can clearly recall the horror of that day so vivid in my memory.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">On the mountain road we met soldiers after soldiers. They were badly burned with skins barely hanging on their body. Some had their uniform blown off by the explosion, and they were nearly naked. Their silent march towards death was eerie and unimaginable. A soldier said to the fourteen years old girls crying, “You are Japanese. Be brave and stop crying.”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\"> Our house was near the foot of the mountain. The fire thankfully had stopped burning at the house next door. Yet the roof was partially blown off, and the blue sky was visible from indoors.  My mother suffered great injury from the flying glass. There were dying citizens outdoors begging for water. I had difficulty believing their voices were coming from human beings.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">One of my sisters did not return home that night, and we prayed for her safe return. Four days latter on August 10th we received a message from the refuge center that she was there. My brother went on bicycle and brought her home.\nWhen I saw her my heart almost stopped. Her condition was far worse than the victims I saw before.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\"> Her face arms not protected by the clothing were charred black and swollen to double its size. And maggots were crawling in her wounds.  My brother picked them out one by one with tweezers. My sister thanked him saying, “When you become like myself, I will repay you.” My brother with a smile answered, “No thanks.   I don’t want to be / like you.”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Three days latter, my sister thanked everyone / and died. She was 19 years of age. We loaded her body on a hand truck, and went to the nearby park. We dug a hole, and laid her over fire wood. Our father stayed by himself to cremate his own daughter. The bodies not identified were piled ten together for joint cremation.\nThe nearest kinship kept cremating their loved ones daily till the late fall. Many who appeared healthy, suffered from radiation poisoning, and continued to die one after another. We spent days/ with a fear of whom would share the destiny the next day.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The Atomic Bomb casualty does not end at once. It is harmful to human beings for generations thereafter. There is a great gap in the number of the victims announced by the United States and Japan. The Atomic Bomb brought unthinkable grave disaster and misery to the people of Hiroshima. It appears that the US leaders are trying to downplay the ill effects, knowing that it had been an inhuman act contrary to a nation founded on Christian belief.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Many who perished instantly were senior citizens, infants, children and women. They were non-combat citizens like you and myself. I am of the belief that, if /the US government had truly intended to end the war quickly, the Atomic Bomb could had been dropped in the remote mountain or at a beach  instead of populated cities like Hiroshima or Nagasaki.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Two days ago, the NHK Japanese television  reported the Atomic Bomb victims totaled 237 thousands. A startling figure, isn’t it?\n\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Whenever I think of the agonizing death of the victims, I am grateful to God for allowing me to live to this date.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I, a first hand witness of the terror of the nuclear disaster, firmly believe and pray that  any use of nuclear bombs or missiles be prohibited permanently by all nations. It is to protect the wellness of all ----- -- human, animal, and nature on earth,  ---------  all created by God.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n74  years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I lived on the edge of a residential neighborhood about 2.3 kilometers north of the city center.  The situation with the war was getting worse and worse, and the food rations were often interrupted.  My parents and four sisters had to cultivate the street in front of our house to grow corn and sweet potatoes in order to supplement our diet.  I remember thinking, while I helped water our crops, that the summer was exceptionally hot.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn those days students, in the 4th grade and younger, studied in nearby temples and halls, and only the 5th and 6th grade students used the school campus.  Since I was in the 4th grade, I went to study in a large farm house with a grass roof across the field from our house.  My sister, who was in the 6th grade went to school, which was about 200 meters east of our house.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the morning of August 6, I went to the farm house, carrying my air raid hood as usual.  The air raid warning siren sounded when I was playing in the “classroom.”  Shortly afterwards, the warning was lifted, and I went out to the garden to play with a few other children.  The sky was clear and it was already too hot in the direct sunlight.  I went under a tree for shade and joined a circle of about six kids playing rock, paper, and scissors.  Suddenly, there was a bright flash.  My body was lifted up with the powerful blast that was accompanied by a roar.  It turned dark with dust and ashes and I couldn’t tell what was what.  Over my head was something like a tree branch.  Around me, empty drum barrels and planks of wood piled on top of each other.  It was such a terrible sight, I broke out crying, “Mother! Mother!”  I saw a boy lying by my feet, covered in soot.  I was playing rock, paper, and scissors with him just moments ago.  I instinctively sensed that the boy was dead.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFortunately I was in the shade and wasn’t burned.  The farmhouse with the grass roof caught on fire, gaining momentum with each minute.  Feeling the heat on my back, I ran for my life, back to my house.  As I crossed the vegetable field barefoot, the dirt seemed to swell in mounds.  When I got near my home I noticed that most of the houses were tilted to one side and looked as though they were about to collapse.  People were running left and right, shouting out at each other.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I arrived at the front door, Mother jumped out and hugged me.  She was bleeding.  Shattered glass stuck out from her forehead.  My 5-year-old sister Hisayo and 1-year-old sister Setsuko were unhurt.  But they were terrified and clung to her as they said in wavering voices, “Mother, mother.” The tatami mat  by the front door had buckled out of the floor.  The furniture was in disarray, and we couldn’t get in the house.  Somehow, Mother managed to go in and drag out some brancket and clothes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nJust then, my sister, who was in the 6th grade, came home covered in blood and holding out her arms.  Her clothes were torn to shreds and her arms were puffed up from burns.  It was unbearable to look at her.  I trembled, thinking about what could become of her.  Mother covered my sister’s head with a towel and got ready to take her to a First Aid Station north of the house.  She found a hand cart and laid my sister on it.  Mother carried Setsuko on her back and I took Hisayo by her hand and walked towards the national highway 50 meters to the west.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I looked back, I saw the town already engulfed in black smoke and red flames.  The fire had approached to a point about 500 meters south of where we were.  People fleeing from the city due north overflowed in the road.  Their skin was charred, covered in soot, their hair stood on end, and their tattered clothes clung to their skin.  It was a strange sight.  It was like seeing hell on earth.  We joined the line of people and headed north.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was a person walking next to me who was severely burned.  Her skin hung down, and she was carrying something over her belly that looked like a long piece of cloth.  I heard someone say, “Those are her intestines.  She’s not going to make it.”  Soon she fell over on the side of the street.  There were others who ran out of strength and sat down or fell over.  Others didn’t have the spirit to care or strength to help and just kept walking.  There were soldiers and horses.  A horse suddenly ran out into the fields that spread along each side of the national highway and collapsed.  On the sides of the road were many dead bodies and people who could no longer walk.  I couldn’t afford to think.  I just held Hisayo’s hand tightly and followed after Mother.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’m not sure how much time had passed.  Sometime in the afternoon, Mother got off the national highway.  We were about 10 kilometers north of the city (currently Yasufuruichi).  She took us under a bridge near a stream (currently Furukawa River) and told us to wait there until she returned.  She said she was going to bring my older sister to a First Aid Station since her condition was worsening.  I waited quietly with Hisayo under the bridge.  A kind lady from a farmhouse on the other side of the rice paddies came out and gave us some rice balls.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Something serious happened in town, didn’t it”, she said.  I noticed how hungry I was.  Rain started to fall while we crouched under the bridge.  The sky darkened and the ground was covered in rainwater as black as ink.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMother finally returned a little before sunset.  My sister was lying on the hand cart and had a bandage on her head.  She groaned and complained about her pain.  The city was still burning and the strange stench could be smelled all the way over to the countryside.  But Mother decided to turn back.  “I want to check on the house.  Father might come home,” she said.  I think it was around 4 or 5 p.m.  We walked against the stream of people evacuating to the north.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen we got back, we saw that everything in the area, including our house, had been burned down.  We stood in a daze in front of the smoldering ruins.  Mother dug out some rice and pumpkins from the bomb shelter we had in the yard, and started preparing the food.  Just then, Father came home.  He seemed to be free of burns and injuries and we all rejoiced.  At the time, Father was on communication duty in the caves of the hills near the port of Hiroshima Bay.  He had left Ujina around 8 a.m. after getting off night duty and was caught in the bombing on his way home.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe sunset and embers glowed in the burned field around us.  An indescribable, nose-piercing stench hung in the hot and muggy air.  Father gathered some tin sheets and planks that survived the fire and made a place for the family to sleep.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAccording to my father’s story, he was in a streetcar, near the Ujina line streetcar stop in front of Hiroshima Instructor High School.  There was a bright flash and the streetcar came to a sudden halt.  He was crushed under the bodies of other passengers.  Not knowing what happened, he crawled out of the streetcar, and saw the horrible sight of people covered in burns running around.  He tried to walk home but couldn’t walk through the city that had caught fire.  He crossed the rivers at low tide (there are six rivers in Hiroshima city), went all the way to Mt. Mitaki in the west, and finally made it home at dusk.  Many burn victims and people fleeing the heat of the fire jumped into the rivers.  Many of them died along the riverbanks.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy sister’s condition was deteriorating.  Mother was caring for her, when she found something white on my sister’s head.  They took a careful look and found something like a rock buried in there.  Father took her to the First Aid Station at Oshiba Grade School and had a medical officer examine her.  “It seems a piece of shingle is buried deep, causing meningitis.  But there’s nothing much we can do,” said the medical officer, as he pulled out the piece of shingle and put some mercurochrome on the wound.  The offending piece was triangular and about 4 centimeters across.  The roof shingle was blown off and broken in the blast and had buried itself into my sister’s head.  Since she was outside in the schoolyard, she had suffered burns on the body parts that were exposed and the skin on her arms and legs were peeling off.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThey kept my sister in a classroom, crowded with people lying on straw mats on the floor.  There were people begging for water, and others writhed in pain, covered in blood.  I was too frightened to go in the classroom to see my sister, and I stayed out in the hallway.  According to mother, lying next to my sister was a person whose whole back suffered burns, and the maggots growing in the wounds would crawl over to my sister.  Mother desperately picked out the maggots with chopsticks.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMother tried her best to care for my sister, tending to her wounds and feeding her juice from tomatoes.  But despite her efforts, my sister died while unconscious on August 21.  The city crematorium was overwhelmed with the number of the dead so they cremated my sister’s body in the schoolyard.  Father bawled.  Mother couldn’t bear to watch them torch my sister’s body, and she took us aside and cried all the way home.  There was nothing we could do and we just huddled together, crying.  Father came home at dusk.  It took that long for my sister’s body to burn to the bones.  He buried her bones at the gravesite in Mt.Hiji.  We fell silent in our heart-rending sorrow.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDay after day, people from the neighborhood association gathered dead bodies, piled them up and covered them with tin sheets to burn them.  The awful stench permeated the air.  At night, I remember being terrified by the blue glow of omitted phosphorus over the ember.  Even now, when I see a heat haze shimmering over the asphalt on a hot summer day, the stench comes back to me and makes me feel sick.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFather began to have stomach troubles about 20 days after the bomb.  He had diarrhea and high fever.  As he combed his hair in the morning, he would look into a hand mirror and say, “I’m losing a whole lot of hair.”  I was filled with an indescribable feeling of anxiety.  I had heard people in the neighborhood speaking to each other: “People who were in ‘Pika ’ end up dying suddenly even if they seem healthy,” or, “It’s too late when they start losing their hair.”  Mother and I held our breath in worry every day.  We fed Father uncooked carrots and onions that we had kept in the bomb shelter.  Eventually, he recovered.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was no food in the city.  In the vegetable field in front of our house, the pumpkins were ripening.  The whole family who owned the field had died, and we divided the crop among the neighborhood.  Pumpkins were a delicacy.  We usually ate sweet potato stems.  Once when Mother was away taking care of my older sister, I decided to cook on the barbeque pit, imitating the ladies in my neighborhood.  I put in some kindling and struck a match for the first time in my life.  My heart pounded as I put over the fire a frying pan scavenged from the rubble.  I took sweet potato stems, broke them into pieces of about 5 centimeters, poured in some oil and fried them.  I cooked rice in a cooking pot.  I did my best to take care of my younger sisters while mother was away.  Once in a while, Mother would return and peek in and praise me.  “Kikuko, you’re so good at this,” she would say.  Flattered, I told myself that I would take good care of my sisters.  I looked around for other edible grass and found some lambsquarters, a weed with a reddish hue, and boiled them.  I tried digging for sweet potatoes but they were still about the size of my pinky and too small and tough to eat.\n</p>\nLosing the War</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn August 15, I heard the sound of the radio coming from a room where people of the neighborhood gathered.  The mood was solemn and I couldn’t hear what was being said over the static.  Apparently, it was the emperor speaking.  The older ladies who heard the report on the radio sank down helplessly and started wailing.  I didn’t even know what was going on, but I clung to mother and cried with them.  Even the brawny men were crying.  When I asked mother what had happened, she told me quietly that we had lost the war.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThen one of our neighbors, Mrs. Kono, staggered into the room and hugged mother and the other ladies and started bawling.  They tried to console Mrs. Kono, but there was a sorrowful feeling in the air and my heart filled with remorse for her.  Mrs. Kono had just received news that her daughter, who had been missing, was found dead in a fire cistern in the city.  Every family had lost someone.  Our houses were burned down and now we had lost the war.  I remember feeling fearful over what was in store for us.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSeptember passed and it was time to go back to school.  The school building was useless.  The roof was gone and the 1st floor was completely smashed under the weight of the 2nd floor.  We attended class in the shade of the trees in schoolyard.  Classes were cancelled on rainy days.  They didn’t have any textbooks or teaching supplies.  The rationed straw paper and pencils were not enough for actual academics.  The teachers came and went.  I remember enjoying the scary tales Mr. Sanno (teacher) told us every once in a while.  It was a nice break from the sorrow over losing family members and the hard work of cleaning up the debris.  I looked forward to hearing the ghost stories, but soon that teacher also stopped coming.\n</p>\nAttacked by a Typhoon</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat fall, a powerful typhoon landed on Hiroshima.  The violent rains lasted into the night, while we huddled together in our small hut.  Suddenly, my sister’s photograph, which had been hanging on a post, fell off.  As if on queue, a strong gust of wind tore off the tin sheet that served as the roof and the posts fell over.  We scrambled to a concrete wall that had survived the fires of the bomb and hid behind it.  Out of the blue, the rain and wind subsided and I could see the moon clearly against the sky without a single cloud.  There was silence.  It was a strange deep silence, completely devoid of any sound.  Later I learned that we had been in the eye of the typhoon.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter a little while, I heard a shout break the still of the night.  “The dyke broke!”  It was the voice of the lady who lived near the “Old Camphor Tree of Shinjo” about 100 meters north.  She had a mental handicap and was well known in our neighborhood for often yelling in the streets.  I didn’t think much of what she said, only making a mental note to myself that she too had survived the bomb.   But then water started flooding the area.  Father was away in Tottori on business, and it was just mother and my sisters there.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI hurried mother, who was stumbling while carrying my baby sister.  We ran to Yokogawa.  The water had risen up to my knees and more flowed from behind.  The water kept rising and soon reached the top of my thighs.  It became harder to run.  We ran into a home that had survived the fire and asked them to let us stay.  “We’re overcrowded in here.  You can’t stay,” they said.  We found a home on high ground a few houses down and asked if the owners would take us in.  This time the kind strangers agreed and put us up on the second floor.  The house was already filled with people from the neighborhood.  They all watched the floodwaters flow under the window in silence.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe flood cleansed the city.  All the debris was washed away.  When we faced south from our hut, we could see Ninoshima Island about 20 kilometers away stand out clearly over the sea.  There was nothing left in the city to obstruct our view.  The flood took everything, including the small hut that we were living in, floor and all.  Even the meager amount of clothes and food that we scavenged from the ruins were washed away and we literally had nothing left except for the clothes on our backs.  Losing the war was sad, but even worse was watching people’s lives being destroyed in an instant.  We moved in to our relative’s house that survived the bombing, but it took years before we recovered enough to live life calmly again.\n</p>\nA Sign of Recovery</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDuring the 6th grade, I transferred to Honkawa Grade School.  The school building was built out of concrete, which was rare for the time.  Our days were spent cleaning up bent pieces of iron framework or chunks of concrete.  We got covered in dust as piece by piece, we picked up the rubble, and then they held class briefly.  The hardwood floor of the classrooms had burned off and the concrete underneath was exposed.  It was bumpy like a hot water bag and difficult to walk on.  We went through 7 teachers in one year, and there was hardly enough time to remember their names.  Some of the students had survived the bomb thanks to the evacuation of pupils, but were orphaned when the rest of their family members died.  They lived with other relatives.  We were all traumatized one way or another, and yet, as resilient children, we looked forward to recess when we played games in the schoolyard</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the summertime we swam every day in the river in front of the Atomic Bomb Dome.  The boys would jump off Aioi Bridge, but I stayed on the edge of the river since I couldn’t swim. Bones of the bomb victims still lay here and there in the stone walls, on the edge of the river.  It gives me the shivers looking back on it, to think that we swam among the remains of the dead.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nGradually, calm visited people’s hearts and along with the hammering sounds of reconstruction, people started calling out for peace.  We didn’t want to see the disaster of the atomic bomb repeated in history.  On August 6, 1947, the Mayor of Hiroshima, Shinzo Hamai called out to the world our “Declaration of Peace.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn December of that year, the Emperor visited Hiroshima.  I joined the crowd of citizens gathered around Hiroshima Castle.  I couldn’t see very well through the wall of people, but what I did see was a rather ordinary man dressed in a subdued coat.  He was wearing tall boots and the mud on his boots left a strong impression in my mind.  The people were stirred and excited.  At the time I didn’t understand the significance of seeing someone who had been so admired from afar appearing in front of us as a plain and normal person .</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I advanced to Middle School, the education system changed to a 6-3-3 co-ed system,  and Middle School became compulsory.  My father had me take the entrance exam for Hiroshima Jogakuin, a Christian women’s school.  Jogakuin was the first school in the city to rebuild its school building after the bomb.  My father didn’t believe in young men and women studying side by side, and had resistance towards the new co-ed system.  Our environment was not yet suitable for studying, but anyhow my new student life began at Hiroshima Jogakuin.  It was the spring of 1948.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDuring the war, we had been taught that “The Americans and the English are devils” and studying English was forbidden.  However, under the new democracy the education system changed quite a bit.  We had some English teachers sent from American churches.  They couldn’t speak any Japanese, and communication in English class was very difficult.  Hiroshima was poor and the church provided goods like stationary and cotton cloth with printed flowers.  I enjoyed wearing the blouse that mother made out of the cloth I received.  Some of the teachers had lost family members in the war, and I was humbled by their dedication to their work.\n</p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">A Wish for World Peace</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn 1952, for the 7th anniversary of the Atomic Bomb, they built a new monument in Peace Memorial Park.  A list of names of the casualties was stored inside the monument.   On the plaque the engraved words read, “Please rest in peace.  We shall never repeat the same mistake.”  Once there was some controversy surrounding this sentence, but many movements dedicated to world peace were born around this time.  Then again there were those survivors who felt the movements were too political for their taste.  Many were paralyzed by their grief and found it impossible to speak about their experiences.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nToday, lots of nuclear weapons exist around the world and some large nations even conduct seaside nuclear testing.  The crime against mankind has not been amended.  Many countries, whether they own nuclear weapons or not, are fighting with each other over religious or economical conflicts.  Even now, 60 years after the war, the world seems to be trapped in the cycle of hate and revenge.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs a citizen of Hiroshima, I think it is very important to talk about how the war was started, how the civilians suffered, and how it ended.  As an atomic bomb survivor, I hope that a disaster such as this is never repeated.  I pray sincerely from the bottom of my heart for everlasting world peace.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n…69 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

It was a sure sign of a hot summer day.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat day was a school attendance day.   I leaned against the wall of the school building and picked at the seeds of the bright red, ripe Chinese Lanterns . I got absorbed in speaking with my friends whom I hadn’t seen in a while.  I skipped and chased the light spread across the </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nschool grounds, when suddenly the area became strangely brighter.  Then a thunderous sound shook the earth.  I looked towards the direction the sound came from and observed the blue sky turn into a faded brown.  There was a huge mushroom cloud rising high into the sky.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSome upperclass students led me home, as I ran in confusion.  “Hiroshima city is destroyed in a sea of fire,” the adults were talking among one another.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“They say we can’t even enter the city for 7 years, and trees or grass won’t grow on its soil”.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy aunt called me over and said to me quietly, “Mom, Dad and Kiyoshi-kun may not have survived.”  I told myself that I had lost my parents and brother.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy sister and I were being cared for by my grandmother, on my mother’s side, in the outskirts of Hiroshima ever since the new school year started.  My mother and brother would visit us over the weekends and every time we said goodbye at the station I had been reminding myself that it could be the last time I saw them.  Because of this, I was able to accept the death of my family calmly.  The first A-bomb victim that my grandfather treated was someone with glass stuck in his cheek.  Soon, the waiting room at my grandfather’s clinic filled up with patients.  Bicycles and carts carrying injured people went past our house, without interruption, until late into the night.  It was the march of the dead.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt a little past 3 p.m., we received the news that my parents and brother were alive.  For a while I couldn’t believe it.  At 6:15 p.m., my long awaited family arrived.  They had been walking for over eight hours and were exhausted.  Their injuries were light: a cut on my mother’s hand and on my brother’s temple.  Our family of five was reunited alive.  The joy and happiness I felt that evening will probably be the most intense in my whole life.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe war ended on August 15.  The grown-ups seemed anxious all day.  They gathered in the family room in silence and sat with their heads bowed.  As they listened to Gyokuon Broadcast, all my grandparents, parents, aunts and nurses cried.  It seemed like they had much contemplating to do.  I watched them from the yard with my brother, sister, and cousins, not really grasping the situation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen our world began to settle down, and my mother took to bed with a high fever.  It was caused by the growth on her left wrist.  My 3-year-old brother became unable to stand or sit, and eventually couldn’t even turn over in bed without help after the bombing.  He was so exhausted, he could eat nothing, and others worried about his helpless state.  The joy and relief brought by our unharmed family members’ return was brief.  The atomic bomb disease attacked us one by one.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEven my father, who seemed to be in good health, collapsed in early fall.  He had been walking around the city on the day after the bombing to search for his parents, brother, and nephew.  His 40℃ fever continued for a month.  He could make the thermometer rise to 38℃ degrees just by holding it in his hand.  As I watched this, I experienced premonitions of his death.  Curtains for funerals were put up everywhere along the road from school.  Every day, upon returning home, I would run upstairs wondering if my father was still alive.  He greeted me with his kind gaze.  The relief and happiness that I felt then still brings warmth to my heart.  After wavering between life and death, he recovered miraculously and regained his health completely.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEvery day, my mother and grandmother went to take care of the bomb victims, who were housed in a nearby temple.  “The wounds were full of maggots…” “There’s no medicine or bandages” “That girl didn’t make it, did she?” “It’s terrible.  Every day there are 4 to 5 deaths,” they spoke to each other.  I didn’t like thinking about the tragedy that unfolded in the temple.  It scared me badly.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy home was near Hiroshima Station.  My father, who happened to be home was weeding the garden.  My brother, who was playing in the guesthouse, was blown by the blast and by the time he came to, he was in my father’s arms.  It was very fortunate that they happened to be in the shadow of the building and didn’t get burned by the flash.  My mother was also safe in the kitchen cleaning up.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy mother was scheduled for volunteer labor that day but she couldn’t go because my brother was not feeling well.  The lady who went to volunteer to replace my mother suffered from terrible burns and passed away shortly after returning home.  Our hearts were full of pain because of the lady who vicariously suffered and died for my mother.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe roof of our home caved in and the tatami  mats were thrown out of their frames in the floor, but the western-style guest room survived the blast.  My parents welcomed the neighbors who escaped death and continued to administer first aid until the fires chased them away.  My mother would cry when she told me about my good friend Kinu-chan.  She was in the bombing while she attended the morning assembly at her junior high school.  She came home with scorched skin hanging from her arms and legs, screaming for her mother.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy 3rd year in grade school was a tough year.  All at once I lost my grandparents, uncle and cousins on my father’s side of the family, as well as many others close to me.  People calling for help buried under dirt and beams; people begging for water: my parents had to leave many behind as they fled, and all they could do was to fold their hands in prayer when they passed by another dead body.  They watched those suffer who survived for a few days.  I wondered if their experience of encountering such devastation had left a scar on their hearts.  I had wanted to ask them if the bitter experience had become one of their largest regrets in life.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOnce, I hesitantly brought up in our conversation the memories of the atomic bomb.  It had been a topic that we had all avoided.  There were no fond memories of that time.  In the end, my father simply said, “I don’t want to remember it.”  The wounds of my father’s heart had not healed 50 years later.  I realized once again the depth of this wound.  War hurts and destroys many people’s bodies.  But now I recognize the reality that the pain suffered by those who cared for the injured and dead is even deeper.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHiroshima is the world’s first city to experience the atomic bomb.  What is written on the cenotaph, “Rest in peace: For we shall not repeat the evil.” is meant for the whole world.  It took 220,000 lives in an instant and wounded many bodies and hearts.  I believe it is Hiroshima’s burden and responsibility to share the experience of the tragedy.  I lament over my powerlessness whenever I present myself with the question: what can I do now, in order to make this world a place without war?  How can we create a peaceful planet?</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhile we do not know when the war in Iraq will come to an end, the state of the world is getting more and more unstable, triggering off conflict all over the world.  I am eagerly searching for what I can do to build a peaceful world, a world with no wars.  But I feel impatience at not being able to find any clue as to my own way of contributing world peace.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n…68 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

I’ve been asking survivors in our church to write their memoirs.  Wouldn’t you write one, too?”  He is a  minister at Hiroshima Nagarekawa Church (before the war, it was called Japan Methodist Hiroshima Central Church: my parents were members.)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn August 6, 1945, when the bomb was dropped, although I was having a difficult time comprehending what I was experiencing, I didn’t faint or become delirious.  I remember the order of the occurrences clearly.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt took me a year of thrashing around as I wrote, and in October of 1970 I finally sent my memoir to Reverend Tanimoto.  He planned to publish the collection of memoirs, but he retired before he accomplished this plan and passed away in October of 1986.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI don’t know what happened to the manuscript that I sent to Reverend Tanimoto.  After all, it has been 20 years since then and half a century since the bomb was dropped.  I shall be satisfied if a few church members read it.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThis is simply a record of one person’s actions.  History changes depending on the observer and cannot be painted into one picture.  For the same event, there are a hundred different stories from a hundred different points of view.  When I take a look at myself and my siblings, who all seem to be healthy, I realize that it is important to investigate the damage caused by the atomic bomb, not only from a medical perspective but also from a sociological standpoint.  My view is not common.  However, I would like to share my experience of surviving through the extreme conditions brought on by the war.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAugust 6, 1996</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n(Member of Asagaya Church, Employee of Mitubishi Electronics)\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn July 1945 indications of the end of the Pacific War were showing.  I took a week off to spend with my parents in Hiroshima.  Although I was a student, I had been working in construction for the 2nd Keihin National Highway, mobilized to the factory and farm and training for the Student Airline Federation.  Classes were held only once in two weeks and campus life was not something that I was familiar with.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn November 1944 I experienced many bombings, starting with daylight reconnaissance by B-29 bomber planes and the air raid of our capitol, incendiary bomb attacks and rifle rakes by smaller planes.  After living through waves of battles and fires of war, I was thrown off balance by the relaxed atmosphere of Hiroshima.  The battle lessons from Tokyo and other major cities had not been integrated into the neighborhood associations of this small city.  Only once did I hear the rumor that Hiroshima was the target for a single B-29 attack.  The public spread false rumors such as “Hiroshima won’t get bombed because Truman (American president of the time) has a lover who is from here.”  Some acquaintances suggested I return to Hiroshima because Tokyo was too dangerous.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe construction of Japanese homes is rather resistant to bombing.  Unless the bomb falls directly on the house, even bombs that fall right next to the house cannot destroy the house completely.  I learned from experience that the bombs themselves did not cause fire, either.  Smaller cities such as Fukui and Utsunomiya had already been bombed.  I instinctively sensed that there was a reason that Hiroshima had not yet been attacked.  Was it possible that the landscape made it difficult to bomb, or were the air defense troops set up well?  Whatever the reason, Hiroshima will probably be bombed within 10 days.  When that happens, I thought to myself, with my experience I would lead my parents and sisters to safety and go back to Tokyo after things calmed down.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIf I went to college, I didn’t think I would really get to study.  There weren’t many factories that were hiring.  Even the numbers of fighter planes that needed to be maintained were few.  The only option left for my future seemed to be to create and lead Volunteer Army Corps Organizations composed of the old folks from the neighborhood associations or young middle school students.  I spent my days with an apathetic attitude.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn August 1 and 2 my sister Kiyoko and I stuffed our backpacks with food and went to visit our younger sister Aiko.  Kiyoko had just graduated from high school.  Aiko was a 5th grader at Hiroshima University Grade School, staying in the countryside in refuge with her schoolmates.  The young citizens were happy to see people from the city for a change and clung to us.  We stayed overnight in the main building of a dark temple.  In the middle of the night, I woke up to the sound of a B-29 flying in the distance and laughed bitterly to myself over the strange habit I had developed.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn August 3 it seemed that the American Task Force appeared on the shore of Shikoku and the Navy Ports in Kure were attacked by small planes, a few days in a row.  Large groups of B-24 Consolidated Liberator Bomber Planes and P-38 Lightning scout planes from Okinawa arrived daily in concord.  I put my metal helmet on, climbed up on the roof of the house across the street with the old men of the Citizen’s Defense Reserve and shouted “Enemy plane attacks; evacuate!”  Usually in the event of small plane rifle rakes, the bullets that ended up in closets would start fires.  Residents were told to leave their doors open during air raids for these reasons.  In the Kanto area  this battle lesson was now commonsense but in Hiroshima, nobody seemed to know about it.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe large group of B-24 Liberators was on the bombing course from south to north.  Arriving over the southern part of Ujina, they suddenly changed their course due west.  An antiaircraft gun in Eba made a direct hit on one of the planes and shot it down.  I can still see the image of two bright white parachutes against the blue sky.  The enemy planes in the sky above Kure did summersaults one after another and dove down.  At the time my eyesight was better than perfect when I used both eyes, and I excelled among my classmates in distinguishing the types of aircraft.  The planes dancing around in our sky were all American planes with white stars on them.  Most of them were Grumman F6F Hellcats or Douglas SB2C Helldivers, the likes of which we saw often in Tokyo.  Once they dove and dropped bombs, they usually stayed low over the ocean to wait for the others, and judging by how we could not see the planes after they descended, this time seemed to be no exception.  Each time a plane descended, the old man next to me would yell out joyfully, “Enemy plane shot down!”  No matter how much I explained that they were just diving and not being shot down, he wouldn’t agree.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEvery time a Hellcat 20 kilometers away turned toward us, the old man would shout; “Evacuate!”  In the case of rifle rakes by small planes, evacuation was useless unless you ran away at a right angle from the plane.  I gave up and decided to look on the air raid in silence.  The attack lasted from morning to sunset.  It was frustrating to think that if this were Tokyo, we wouldn’t have allowed the attack to last this long.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy classmates from middle school had joined the army, and I didn’t have anyone to hang out with.  Between air raids I took naps or looked through the memorabilia left over at our empty home in Takara-machi, which awaited demolition.  In Tokyo demolition of homes within 50 meters from railroads was enforced in order to prevent the spread of fire and protect the transportation systems.  The fire belt created in this way was rather effective, and Hiroshima and other cities began to adopt the fire belt system.  Demolition of buildings and homes was started, and Mother was asked to come and help at such sites on a daily basis.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the night of August 5, the air raid alert was announced after 8 p.m.  Many small towns were being air raided.  Planes dropped mines over Tokuyama, Kanmon Channel, and the Sea of Japan.  My father, who was on duty at the university, left as soon as the alert went into effect.  My sister, who had been admitted into Jogakuin College just 5 days before, had to join the relief team and left for Kenjo High School for Women.(Note...this year all middle schools and 5-year women’s high schools advanced their students a year and allowed graduation after 4 years.  Due to the Student Mobilization, the higher education schools delayed their admittance 4 months  to August.)  My sister Junko, who had to go to work the next day, slept in her monpe pants.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI kept my puttees on and sat down in the hallway with Mother.  I rubbed her shoulders and feet and spoke with her all through the night.  The air raids had thrown people’s lives off schedule, and many families lost their quality time together.  Mother’s stories went on and on: about the time when she got married to my father; when my sisters were born; her hopes for our future.  I never even dreamed that these stories would be her dying will.  I will record here what, in particular, I remember.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was born while my father was studying abroad at Chicago University.  By the time he returned to Japan, I had already turned a year old and didn’t warm up to him.  Father also didn’t feel like I was his own, and this worried Mother.  Finally after 19 years I was developing affection towards Father.  Mother heartily expressed the importance of the Father being around at childbirth.  Since I was the oldest son, I had been planning on having Mother live with me eventually when she was done raising her children.  But Mother disliked the idea of having to live with my future wife and talked about living apart for at least 10 years, until she had a few grandchildren.  When I received my first 20-yen bill from the Student Mobilization Workforce, I put aside 5 yen for Mother.  There were no goods back then that were suitable for gifts so I just sent her a money order.  She took it to the post office and exchanged it for cash, and kept it safely for a year and a half.  She told me she would hang onto the precious 5-yen bill that I earned with my sweat.  She seemed to be happy that her son had grown up enough to give her an allowance.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMother had a terribly cautious side to her.  Whenever she heard the sounds of planes during air raid warnings, she would head to the bomb shelter alone in a hurry.  “You don’t have to leave in such a flurry to get to the bomb shelter”, Father would say, unable to contain his laughter.  “I don’t have to live for you but I have to live for my children,” she would reply with a straight face.  Our bomb shelter was located under the tatami of our front door.  It was an indoor evacuation shelter.  If our house was hit directly, it would be impossible to escape from our shelter, so I recommended going to our next-door neighbor’s shelter.  Due to the fact that the city of Hiroshima was built on a delta, you hit water just by digging 60 centimeters into the ground.  Most shelters were half underground, and a good portion of the shelter remained above ground.  My cautious mother seemed to be constantly thinking of the safest way to evacuate.  I explained to her that it’s not difficult to put out the fire caused by a incendiary bomb as long as it is a single occurrence, but it’s impossible to put out a spread fire.  I also told her that it is very difficult to find a safe route once the fire spreads around the neighborhood.  I promised her that in the case of an attack, I would lead the family to safety.  She nodded with my every word.  She gave me credit for having lived through many fires of war.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAll night long, we would drift off until another alert woke us.  At dawn, they finally lifted the warning.  I changed into my pajamas and lay down on the futon.  Mother seemed to be gathering the meager food in the kitchen, getting ready for breakfast.  As I was falling asleep, I heard Mother call out to my sister, who was leaving for the Army Provisions Depot(factory for military food cans).  Father returned from the University and the three of us sat down to have breakfast.  Then Mother took her air raid hood in her hand and left for the building demolition site where she was forced to  help.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFor a little while, I heard her speaking and laughing with the ladies of the neighborhood outside of the house.  Then she came back in to pick up the white work gloves she had forgotten.  I handed the gloves to her and she looked at me with her kind face.  How was I to know that a few moments later she would be going to heaven and this was the last time I would get to see her?  It was 5 minutes before the fateful 8:15 a.m.  I sat back at the dining room table and had tea with Father.  My head tilted down, I carefully lifted my eyes toward his face.  Until then, I hadn’t even thought about the lack of bond I had with Father.  I felt strange thinking about how, for 20 years, this had been causing Mother such distress.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe fateful 8:15.  A plane approached from the west.  I heard the engine over-boost as it flew towards the city.  I recognized the familiar sound immediately.  “It’s a B-29!” I said.  “No, it can’t be.  There’s no alert”, Father argued back.  In the Kanto area, often the lone scout B-29s were detected too late, and the air raid alert would finally be put into effect when the plane reached the skies over Suginami-ku.  I didn’t have time to argue with Father over the urgency of the situation we were in.  “It’s a parachute!” I heard someone shouting outside.  Hurriedly, I put the teacups on the kitchen counter, still half full.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was a white-blue flash outside the window.  I wasn’t sure what had happened, and I headed for the front door to go outside.  The windows had grilles and the only way out of the house was from the front door.  (Father, who was sitting facing the epicenter, said he thought we were in an air raid when he saw the duster hanging in the hallway catch fire and then chased after me).  The ceiling crumbled and crashed down in front of my eyes.  I ran with my arms over my head.  There may have been an incredibly loud noise, but I don’t remember.  Father and I were buried under the house and dust.  I felt a fair amount of pressure over my body but managed to continue breathing.  I was lying on my side with my arms protecting my head and legs, buried in the sand from the walls.  (Later I learned that I was wedged into a space created by the staircase that collapsed sideways.  The 180-centimeter wall fell over and leaned against the staircase and saved my upper body from being crushed completely.  Father somehow was buried under me.  Although we were trapped under the 2-story building, at least we weren’t exposed to the searing beam, thanks to the roof shingles.  In addition, we were exposed to less first-hand radiation than the people who were outside.)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt became harder to breathe in the dusty darkness.  Fortunately I had not fainted or gotten delirious.  For someone so scatterbrained, I think I handled the situation quite well.  However, it seemed I was in a state of excitement and my body was hot.  I was concerned about Father who was buried alive with me.  “Dad!  Are you alive?”  I heard an energetic reply from under me.  “I’m alive, but I can’t move.”  “I can’t move, either.  Mom’s outside so I’m sure help will be on its way soon.  Hang in there.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy mind spun around in a flurry.  Was it an earthquake?  No, if it were an earthquake, the tatami  mats would have been shaking so badly that I wouldn’t have been able to run that fast.  There was the sound of a B-29.  There was no alert but it must have dropped a bomb.  Had we been hit directly?  Even so, I’m surprised that the whole house would be destroyed like this.  There must have been an electrical time superquick on the bomb.  That’s it!  I had heard the American military started using them because they were effective for destroying Japanese houses and killing men and horses.  I wonder if the bomb was a #25 (250 kilograms) or a #10 (100 kilograms)?  Either way, it must have been a medium-sized bomb that hit our house directly.  Mother, who is outside, will come and rescue us, I believed.  How about a fire?  Japanese homes don’t combust on their own from a bomb, I told myself.  The sound of the house collapsing and settling into itself subsided and it became eerily quiet.  Two to three minutes must have passed.  Unlike my expectations, I didn’t hear any commotion outside.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Hey, there are two people alive in here!” I shouted.  There was no response.  Carefully, I opened my eyes.  I thought I was buried in darkness, but the area was much brighter than expected.  I opened my eyes all the way and saw through the thin haze, a sunbeam in the corner.  There was nothing blocking the way.  If I could get my legs to break free, I could escape.  I’ll be safe!  Hope arose in me.  I pulled my left leg as hard as I could, toward my chest.  The wall crumbled as it made a dry sound.  Then I moved my right leg, not caring what else crumbled.  I was able to pull both of my legs out of the dirt.  I was curled up on my side like a shrimp.  It was not easy to stretch out my body.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“I can see some light.  I think I can get out.  Once I get out, I’ll help you,” I called to Father.  He didn’t answer, except for some moans.  I grew impatient thinking I had to save him in a hurry, but my body was still under the rubble.  I used the technique taught to me in school training, creeping on my forearms and toes (its purpose was to advance silently in a night battle) and moved forward a few meters.  I stuck my head out of the crack: I must have been too confused because I cut the left side of my neck (I still have a large scar from it).  I could poke my head out but my shoulders got stuck and I couldn’t get out.  The bamboo that was built into the walls was getting in my way.  I pulled my head back in under the wall and tried to do it over.  This time I couldn’t even get my head through.  I used one hand to break the wall bit by bit and finally got out.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIs there a fire?!  I looked around but saw no signs of fire.  My head was gritty from the dust so I went to the water tank by the front door and washed my face.  The water was very dirty but it was not time to be picky.  I washed out my eyes and rinsed my mouth.  Suddenly I became thirsty so I lowered my face to the surface of the water and drank.  I calmed down a bit and looked around.  There was not a house around that survived.  The top of our 2-story house used to be about 10 meters high, but now it was smashed like a matchbox and was only as tall as my chest.  When I took a closer look I could tell that the 2nd floor of the house next door was on top of our house, and our 2nd floor was in our neighbor’s yard.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI could not comprehend what had happened, except that we were bombed quite badly.  This was when I first saw large pillars of smoke rising to the heavens.  I could tell that fires had started in several places, but they were still quite far away.  I still had time.  I stood on top of the roof of my house but I had no idea where Father was buried.  I couldn’t even tell where I had been buried.  I listened for Father’s groans and started peeling off the shingles.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSomeone ran by and screamed as if they were out of their mind.  I wanted to search for help but it didn’t seem feasible under these circumstances.  After a little wile, the daughter (I think she was 11 or 12 at the time) of the Hayashi family across the street climbed out of a smashed house.  She was bleeding from her face but otherwise seemed to be injury-free.  She ran away due east in her underwear with her hair wild and as she yelled out “My mother, my mother.”  I continued to peel off the roof shingles and hit the ceiling board with my fist to break through.  I could still hear Father moaning.  My neighbor, Mr. Iki, appeared and asked me what was wrong.  I told him my father was buried underneath.  He took a look and said in a light tone, “Goodness, this is not a task for your bare hands.  I’ll go get a jack.  We’ll also need more people.  Wait here.”  I glanced at his eyes for a moment. I could not find even a glimmer of sanity there.  He disappeared.  I’m not going to rely on anyone else.  I’m my only hope, I told myself.  I continued to remove the ceiling by hand.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOnce I removed the ceiling, a low wall of about 90 centimeters was revealed.  The moaning was now closer but seemed to be getting weaker.  I tried to lift the wall by myself but it didn’t budge.  Once again, I continued to hit the wall with my fist until a portion crumbled and I broke the bamboo rods inside.  (As a result of using my hands, I didn’t harm my father’s body).  Once the wall was removed, I could see part of Father’s back.  He was lying on his stomach and a frame crossed over the middle of his back.  On the frame was a stick of about 3 centimeters wedged at a right angle.  I touched Father’s back and could feel that he was still warm.  I gathered all my might and pulled the stick out.  My father who was moaning in his delirium let out a yelp.  He must have felt pain.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“I’m almost there.  Hang in there,” I encouraged him.  I looked for another stick, wedged it under the frame and lifted it with all my strength.  I made a space of about 10 centimeters between the frame and Father’s back.  “Now!  Get out!”  I yelled.  “I can’t move.  My legs are numb,” he replied.  I couldn’t hold up the lever and pull him out at the same time.  I called for help but there was nobody around.  I found another stick to wedge under the lever, and dug the dirt under Father’s body with my hands.  I pulled his body out as if I were unearthing a huge radish.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI scanned his body and he didn’t seem to be injured.  My only concern was the swelling on his back about the size of a soup bowl.  I carried him and started walking due east on our street.  I felt it was important to get out to a wide road as soon as possible.  It was not easy to walk down the road, because many fallen beams and telephone poles blocked the way.  I would throw Father over a telephone pole, and then climb over it myself to get to the other side.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOnce we came to the road that led to Hijiyama Bridge, I saw many injured people.  I found an Army Service Corps cart lying on its side so I put Father in the Officer’s Impedimenta.  I wondered where to go next.  I stopped in the middle of the wide road to avoid the blazing fires and looked around.  Just then, a student wearing an air raid hood approached.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Aren’t you Mr. Hiraiwa?” he asked.  I took a careful look and realized it was Mr. Nakane, whom I had met a few days ago at the Zoology Department at Hiroshima University of Literature and Science (currently Hiroshima University).  “I managed to dig out my father but I still don’t know where my mother is,” I told him.  “I’ll take your father to a safe place.  Hurry and go find your mother,” he said.  It would have been good sense to talk about how we were going to find each other later, but I was in such a state of tumult that I ran back toward the house as soon as I thanked him.  Where could Mother be?</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOnce I arrived at my house, a lady from across the street jumped out at me wearing just her underwear.  “Mr. Hiraiwa, my mother and child are in there,” she said, weeping and grabbing my arm.  I looked into the flattened house and called out, “Where are you?  Are you alive?”  There was no response.  I saw a leg under the rubble so I reached in to touch it.  It was cold.  I was becoming anxious to find Mother so I told the lady to go for help while I tried to dig them out.  She ran east.  When I looked up, I saw some smoke rising.  I saw the crumbled Alliance Church two houses down catch on fire.  I could put it out if I tried now, I thought.  I picked up a bucket that was on the ground and dunked it into the water in a nearby fire cistern.  I threw buckets full of water on the fire, over and over, secretly feeling like a lone hero.  I was able to put the small fire out.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI went to the building demolition site about 40 meters away from our home.  I was too shy to call out for Mother by her name, so I yelled, “Is there anyone here?  Are there any survivors?”  It seemed anyone who was able to break free had done so already and left.  There was nobody around.  I flipped over some pieces of lumber to see if anyone was buried, but I found nothing that resembled a body.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI wondered if Mother had escaped, or if she was injured and carried away by someone.  If she was conscious, she would be concerned about our home.  The building demolition site that she was headed to was certainly in this area.  It couldn’t be far from home, because she and others gathered at the worksite and came back in such a short time to pick up the work gloves she had forgotten.  I was perplexed.  This block in my mind led to my misjudgment.  Of course, at the time there was no way of knowing that the world’s first atomic bomb had just been dropped.  However, since it was in the middle of summer, I should have looked in the areas that would have been in the shade.  In fact, Mother’s body was later found 20 meters to the west of where I was searching.  If Mother had still been alive an hour after the bomb, the last human voice that she had heard would have been mine: “Is there anyone here?  Are there any survivors?”  I looked frantically in the area where the building demolition site had been the day before.  I lifted as many pieces of lumber as I could until my strength failed me.  I noticed the clear sky had begun to darken.  The fire was approaching.  It was no longer the size that could be handled alone.  Covered in blood, I screamed out, “MOM, WHERE ARE YOU?!”  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was a parting shriek to my mother of 19 years.  I dragged my heavy feet and returned to the front of our house.  The bottom of my feet hurt.  I finally realized that I was walking on broken glass with my bare feet.  I found our shoe rack that had tumbled over and pulled out a pair of women’s geta  with new straps.  The roof, windows, and walls of western-style structure that we used as a guesthouse were completely blown away but the piano miraculously survived the blast and stood there alone covered in dust.  It was Mother’s trousseau from twenty-something years ago.  I opened its lid and hit a key with my right index finger.  The note sounded like a requiem for my childhood home that was about to be swallowed in the flames of war.  I picked the dolls of Tyltyl and Mytyl of The Blue Bird off the floor.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThen I heard some blasts in the distance.  My instinct told me they were the sound of high angle guns.  The sky above was covered by smoke, and I couldn’t see if there was a barrage of bullets.  Pieces of debris fell from the sky.  I sensed danger.  I picked up a pot that had tumbled out into the street and put it over my head.  The thin aluminum felt like steel.  I took a last look around my neighborhood.  Maybe I should have saved the old lady and boy across the street, and Mrs. Hayashi.  But I have no strength left.  The fire approached.  In about three minutes’ time it’ll be too late.  Forgive me.  I ran towards the wide road without looking back.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOnce I got to the main road, I realized that the air had changed from before.  People whose clothes were torn were walking slowly or lying on the side of the street.  I didn’t see the typical injuries that were caused by blasts of bombs.  There was a man wearing officer’s boots and belt lying on the street.  Other than his loincloth, he didn’t have any clothes on.  He was obviously an officer from the Imperial Japanese Army.  I was utterly confused.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHaving woken up right before the bomb, I was still in my pajamas.  Looking at the officer, I said to myself that if I had the time to put on my boots, I would have taken my military sword with me, too.  There was a female student who was wearing only a white work shirt.  A woman wore a polka-dot tube dress, which had holes in the dots.  The appearance of bomb victims was quite different from what I was used to seeing in the Keihin area.  I walked toward Hijiyama Bridge and came by a military policeman.  He was yelling.  I approached, tapped his shoulder and yelled back at him at the top of my lungs:  “We’ve been hit!  We will avenge.  But first we must lead the injured to safety.  Once one person sits down everyone loses their momentum and ends up sitting down, too!  If we stay here we’ll be surrounded in smoke.  Give me the whistle.  I’ll do it!”  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThis was the first and last time in my life that I yelled at the intimidating military police.  The stunned policeman froze, and then saluted me.  “You are injured.  There is a first aid station over there.  Please get treated there.  I can take care of this,” he said and pointed toward the telegraph corps station on the other side of the bridge.  I wished him well and started walking.  From the bridge I could see that the city center was engulfed in red flames.  On the bridge lay many injured people who could no longer go on.  There were only a few people who were walking.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere were two medical orderlies at the telegraph corps station.  The left half of my pajamas was died red with blood.  The blood dripped down and soaked my loincloth.  I figured that I had been cut somewhere but nothing seemed to be wrong with the left half of my body so I hadn’t been concerned about it.  (Later my father said that while I was carrying him he noticed the gaping wound on the left side of my neck, but kept silent on purpose for fear that I might go into shock.)  I went up to the medical orderly and asked, “I’ve hurt myself.  Could you please treat my wound?”  “Yes,” he said, but then I saw many heavily injured people lying around by my feet.  “I’ll wait my turn, since my injury is light,” I said.  “These people have been treated.  Here, this will sting a little but you can handle it,” he said, soaking some absorbent cotton in iodine.  He swiped it over my wound and it stung like hell.  I finally realized that my wound was much more serious than I had thought.  “The bleeding has stopped.  You were very close to cutting the carotid artery.  You’re quite lucky.”  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI felt all the strength drain from my body.  They put yellow powder of iodoform on my wound and wrapped my neck and head twice with bandages.  I told them I only needed them to go around my head and neck once so that they could conserve their medical supplies.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“You’re the only laceration patient we’ve had.  Everyone else is a burn victim,” said the orderly.  More burn victims were arriving as we spoke.  Every time one arrived, they would take a big brush normally used for spreading paper on sliding doors,  dip it in turpentine and spread the yellow liquid over the burns.  That was it.  “There really is no good way to treat full body burns like this,” said one of the soldiers.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBurns!  Burns without dingy marks!  The victims’ faces were round and their eyes were in slits.  That’s why they didn’t have clothes on: they had burned off, I was beginning to comprehend.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe medical orderly said to me, “Don’t drink water, or you’ll die.”  That much medical knowledge I had, but I thanked him and started to walk away.  “Hey,” a noncommissioned officer stopped me.  “If you are able to walk, can you ask these victims lying around here their name and address, write it down on these pieces of paper and put them near the bodies?  Civilians don’t have dog tags so it’s hard to identify the bodies.”  He handed me 20 to 30 pieces of straw paper and a pencil.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI walked over to the group of victims as I was told.  The majority of them were already unconscious or delirious.  I crouched down near a female student who seemed to have control over her facilities.  “Hey, get yourself together.  Are you O.K.?” I used a harsh tone of voice on purpose, thinking that if I treated her too kindly she would become deflated.  “Yes,” she responded weakly.  “What’s your name, age and school?  Your address?  Your legal address on family registry?” I asked what was necessary in quick succession and slid my pencil across the paper.  Her voice was raspy and I had to put my ear to her mouth to make out her answers.  I do not remember her name.  I think she was a student at Kenjo High School for women (currently Hiroshima Minami High School).  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAmong her answers was a question; “What happened to the B-29?”  She had enough sense left to be aware that we were in a war.  “We shot it down.” I made up an answer.  “Hang in there.”  She nodded slightly.  Her whole face was covered with blisters from the burns and had no facial expression.  “Water,” her lips moved vaguely.  I took her wrist and read her pulse.  Even a layman could tell that her pulse was inconsistent.  I forced her swollen eyelids open to look at her pupil.  It was dilated, perhaps because her eyes were closed for so long.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI waved my hand in front of her eye but got no reaction.  “Get yourself together.  Can you see me?” I shouted, but she remained expressionless.  I sensed her lease on life was coming to an end.  I stood up to search for water.  There were no water pipes or any decent homes nearby.  I picked up an empty can and gathered some relatively clean water from the fire cistern.  I tried to sit her upright but she resisted.  I pried her mouth open and poured the water in.  I can’t be sure, but she seemed disappointed.  I read her faint pulse again.  There was nothing left to do for her.  Even if I were to call one of the medical orderlies over, they probably wouldn’t have any morphine for her.  I put down the piece of paper with her name and put a rock on top of it.  If it rained or a strong gust of wind blew, the paper would no doubt be lost in no time.  With her face so distorted, even her parents would have a difficult time identifying her body.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe number of injured people in the field was increasing.  Everyone had suffered burns.  They all had swollen faces and looked the same, similar to that of a prehistoric man.  I assumed most of them were middle school students who had been mobilized and working outdoors.  They were all quiet, as though they had ran out of strength and spirit.  The ones yelling were middle-aged men and women.  I felt my duty to record the names of the injured was pointless.  I kept getting asked for water left and right as long as I stood near the burn victims.  I wondered if this is what people would call a living hell.  I could tolerate the scene no longer and walked away.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA short distance away, I saw an injured person in a ditch.  When I approached, he lifted both of his arms and asked for help.  I intended to pull him up to the street and looked at his hands.  They were cut and covered in blood.  I squatted down on the side of the road and pulled him by his elbows.  His skin slipped off in my hands.  Both of his arms had been turned into huge blisters.  I lost my composure and jumped down into the ditch.  I pushed him up onto the street.  I ran away, leaving him groaning on the street.  What could have happened that he would suffer such terrible burns when most of his clothes were still intact?  I searched my memory for the war lessons I learned when old downtown Tokyo was air raided on March 10.  I did not find an answer.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhile I walked on the east side of Mt.Hiji, I remembered Mother had told me that she had arranged to flee to Mr. Genshiro Sawano’s residence in the case of a fire.  They were friends from the Nagarekawa Church, and we had stored some of our family belongings at his house.  I decided I would head there.  Most of the homes on the eastern side of Mt. Hiji seemed to have survived the blast, except for the windows and some roof shingles.  When I came to Matoba-cho, both sides of the road were burning wildly and I couldn’t advance any further.  A single tri-wheeled fire truck pumped water while a few firemen fought the fire to no avail.  The water pressure was weak: either the truck didn’t have enough horsepower or the hose was too long.  It was like pouring water over sizzling rocks.  Water squirted out from a broken fire hydrant.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI knew it was bad for my body to drink the water, even without the warning from the medical orderly.   I decided to gargle and put my mouth to the shooting water.  After rinsing my mouth out a few times, I was suddenly struck by thirst.  I couldn’t contain myself and took a gulp.  It was delicious.  It was very delicious.  I didn’t care what happened to me any longer.  I drank as much water as my stomach could hold.  I wasn’t concerned about life or death.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOnce I calmed down, I pictured the map of Hiroshima in my mind.  I figured the wooden bridges had already burned down.  I wondered how I could get to Hiroshima Station.  I wasn’t sure.  Unable to pick a route, I just headed back the way I came.  I thought of going to Hiroshima University, where Father worked.  It was a long way around but I decided to take the Miyuki Bridge.  I hurried past the Army Clothing Depot (factory for military uniforms).  I didn’t want to pass in front of the communication troop station again for the sneaking suspicion that they might assign me the same duty again.  I also felt bad about leaving the patients there and couldn’t bear to face them again.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe Minami-machi area was not damaged badly.  Some of the homes were partially destroyed.  I found a group of people mingling around one of the half-broken homes.  When I peeked in with curiosity, someone yelled “It’s a bomb” and everyone scattered.  Was it a due or a time bomb?  Either way it didn’t make sense that a bomb that was dropped from 10,000 meters above would land in soft ground with its tail sticking out without exploding.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIf it were a #25 bomb (250 kilograms) we would have to back up 300 meters to be safe.  People had stopped in a circle of about 50 meters in diameter.  It was dangerous.  “Where’s the bomb?” I asked one of the men.  “Over there”, he pointed, his finger trembling.  “If it’s really a bomb we need to notify the army in order to dispose of it.  I need to take a look, so tell me where it is.”  “It’ll go off if you get near it.”  “If it’s a time bomb there’s no way of knowing when it’ll explode.  Anyway, I’ll take a look, so show me exactly where it is,” I yelled.  Faced with my fury, he shuddered and followed me unwillingly.  “There it is.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI saw a black metal object in the direction he pointed.  I couldn’t yet tell what it was, but it was not the tail of a bomb, no matter how you looked at it.  I stepped over some rubble and got closer and saw that it was a tea can.  I put my ear to it just in case, and checked for any ticking sounds.  Obviously, I heard nothing.  I picked up the tea can.  It was light, as I imagined.  I looked around to see if there was anything else that resembled the tail of a bomb.  There was nothing of the sort.  “Hey, is this it?” I threw the tea can up in the air.  People let out little screams and backed up.  They were no different from little children mistaking dead branches for ghosts.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMiyuki Bridge was also filled with burn victims.  Women with their hair in disarray, old folks in a daze; not many were bleeding.  I just couldn’t comprehend why people would get burned like this from a bomb blast (back then, they didn’t have napalm or canister bombs).  It was hard to look directly at the burn victims, and I didn’t want someone to ask me to start identifying people again so I crossed the bridge in a hurry.  (There is a famous photograph of Miyuki Bridge taken by a Chugoku Newspaper cameraman right after the bombing: by the time I crossed the bridge it was past noon and it looked quite different.)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI walked past the Hiroshima Electric Railroad Company and entered the main gate of the University.  The advanced training building built out of wood and the school building of my alma mater Hiroshima University Grade School, were already completely burned down.  The Hiroshima University Grade School building and the university buildings built of concrete and steel were burning.  There were a few charred black bodies here and there.  I couldn’t figure out how the concrete and steel building could be on fire.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere weren’t even any wooden structures nearby that could have started the fire.  (I was told later that the chemicals in the chemistry lab combusted from the beam of the bomb and started a fire.)  I thought about going to Father’s lab, but it was too hot to go inside.  His lab was on the first floor so I jumped up to see in through the windows.  Everything inside had been burned.  I had come in hopes of grabbing something human-like to wear out of Father’s wardrobe that he kept there.  I was disappointed.  Tattered pajamas covered in blood were not working out for me.  I walked across the schoolyard of Hiroshima University Grade School.  I kicked a small pebble with my geta.  It hit the belly of a naked dead body.  The skin broke and water flowed out of the belly.  The inflated belly flattened after all the water poured out.  I’m not sure if I had lost my sanity by then, I didn’t feel any emotion.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI exited the main gate of Hiroshima University Grade School and turned my head left and right.  Fires were still burning, and I could see the mountains of Koi to the west.  At that moment, I decided to visit my sister at the Army Provisions Depot.  I had suddenly become lonely and craved the company of my family.  I no longer thought about bridges or taking the longer but safer route.  If the bridges weren’t there, I’d just swim across the rivers.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI arrived at Takano Bridge and saw, once again, many burn victims gathered in the heat.  Several fire trucks from the Fire Department Headquarters had been burned where they were parked.  The street on the west side of Takano Bridge was not very wide and even with the fire out, the heat from smoldering buildings was still quite hot.  Although I knew it was a futile effort to dunk my bare feet and getas in water, I wetted my feet every time I saw water.  Charred black bodies were lying around everywhere in the smoldering ruins.  I had seen a pile of burned bodies before when I walked past the Meiji Shrine after the last Tokyo air raid in May, so I was not shaken by this view.  But when I saw the dead body of a mother protecting her child, tears came to my eyes.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI went further west.  I noticed the asphalt road was wet.  It had not rained on the eastern half of the city where I had been walking around.  I looked around at the tatami mats of the houses that survived the fire and noticed they were all wet and stained black.  I wondered if the rain that fell through black smoke became black.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI ran into Mrs. Iwaoka, the mother of my grade school classmate, at the hill near Koi Grade School.  (My classmate Mikio had become a fighter plane pilot after graduating from the Japanese Naval Flight Training Program.  He joined the Kisarazu Fleet and died in 1943 when he got caught in a propeller of a plane that he was guiding on the ground.)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Mr. Hiraiwa, what happened?” she asked.  “We were hit.  I saved my father but I don’t know what happened to my mother.”  I saw tears stream from her eyes.  She gave me one of Mikio’s pants that she had kept.  I put them on, thanked her, and headed to Koi Grade School to look for my sister, Junko.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“What’s wrong,” my sister asked, as soon as she saw my face.  “I left father with someone else after saving him.  I don’t know where mother is”, I answered, quickly.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy sister’s boss Niki First Lieutenant (currently working in the office of technology at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries) came and gave me a shirt.  My sister was excused early from work and together we walked back the way I came.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy sister, who was still excited, kept talking about what happened to her that morning.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“There was a bright flash and I looked around.  I thought someone had taken a photograph.  Then a man yelled and told us to get under the desks, so I did.  The people who didn’t duck for cover fast enough suffered injuries to their heads.  Everyone made fun of me for ducking so fast, because usually I’m really slow at doing things.  Lots of people were wounded, weren’t they?”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy sister, who had no idea what had been happening in the city, spoke in a carefree manner.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI briefly told her about what I had been doing that day.  She stopped in her tracks when she saw a burned dead body lying on the street.  “He was burned to death.  It’s much worse up ahead.  There are a bunch of dead bodies.  Don’t look around, just look straight ahead and walk,” I told her in a fierce manner.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBy the time we arrived by Takano Bridge, my sister was beginning to understand the gravity of the situation.  She spoke quietly,  “This morning when I left home, Mother called to me.  She didn’t have anything to say but she kept looking at my face.  I asked her what was wrong and she showed a lonely smile and told me it was nothing.  So that was our goodbye…”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs we came closer to Hiroshima University and Hiroshima University Grade School, we started checking each body, one by one.  We didn’t think that our mother would have run away this way, but we searched just in case.  The burn victims’ faces were disfigured and you couldn’t identify the bodies just by glancing at them.  I remembered the look of Mother’s front teeth, so every time we passed by a woman’s body I checked the teeth.  I also checked bodies that were burned beyond recognition of the sex.  We did not find a body that resembled hers.  As we walked, I told my sister about the talk I had with Mother the previous night.  She had wished for us to grow and thrive.  She wanted to live a peaceful life with her grandchildren.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs I spoke with my sister, I began to believe strongly that Mother was dead.  We came to Chuou Road and tried to get to the burned remains of our house where Mother would have been.  Unfortunately smoldering roof shingles littered the streets and we couldn’t walk any further.  We took out four pieces of dried bread that my sister brought from work and laid them on the ground by the entrance to the road.  We poured water onto the bread as an offering to our mother’s soul.  The four pieces of bread symbolized offerings from her four children.  Although there was no way of knowing whether our sister Kiyoko was alive, for some reason I felt that she was.  I nudged Junko, who stood there with tears in her eyes, and started walking.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI looked over at the school yard of Sanyo Middle School through the broken fence.  There were two survivors standing among about 20 dead bodies.  I called to them.  They were husband and wife.  The wife escaped first and rescued her husband on her own from the approaching fire.  I invited them to go with us.  They said that a family member had died and that she would rather stay there the night and perform the ceremonies of otsuya .</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe long day of August 6 was finally coming to an end as the sun set.  We didn’t have a place to go to and so we hiked into Hijiyama.  The bomb shelters, dug into the hills, were already filled with refugees.  We washed down a few pieces of dried bread and called it a dinner.  Junko and I talked over what to do next.  We agreed that we must try to find our father first.  Then we would look for our sister Kiyoko.  “I wonder if Kiyo-chan is alive,” Junko said weakly.  “Of course she is,” I said firmly, as if I were trying to convince myself.  “What happens next?” asked my sister.  I remembered the rumor among the students and intellectuals in Tokyo: “the flight of the white dove is near.”  “The war will end soon,” I told my sister in a whisper, taking care not to be heard by others.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI lay down on the ground, but ants started crawling up into my collar and I was unable to sleep.  I sat up and saw parts of the city center still up in flames.  They were like the greeting fires of hell.  I heard the engine of a plane overhead.  “Air raid warning; everyone evacuate!” someone yelled.  There was a commotion among the people but Junko and I kept still.  I figured nobody would be so stupid as to bomb a city that had already burned down.  I was still tense and had difficulty falling asleep, but eventually I dozed off.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n(The events of August 6 have remained vividly in my memory, even to this day 25 years later.  However, my memory after that day is fragmented.  Please keep in mind that from here on, the order of my actions is unclear.)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe dawn of August 7 arrived.  The beautiful city of Hiroshima had become a flat gray desert.  The ruins of buildings built out of concrete and steel were the only reminders that there used to be a city.  People were supplying rice balls for the refugees.  Those who spent the night in Hijiyama were in a daze and didn’t seem to want to move.  I urged Junko to get up.  We decided first to go to Jogakuin to see if we could find out about Kiyoko’s whereabouts.  The fire seemed to have burned down everything that could be burned, and had mostly subsided.  The bodies had begun to emit the stench of death.  We traced the barely visible asphalt road and headed to the scorched grounds of Jogakuin College. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe counted somewhere between 10 and 20 dead bodies on the school grounds.  It seemed that there were many more trapped under the rubble.  We came by a few students and asked if they had seen Kiyoko.  A girl who knew her answered, “I’m certain Ms. Hiraiwa escaped.  She and Mr. Toru Ingu (currently professor at the Theology Department of Kansai Gakuin University) put an injured classmate on a hand cart and fled together.”  This student had been with Kiyoko up to a certain point.  We still didn’t know where Kiyoko ended up, but at least now we knew she was alive.  I was anxious to hear some more details but I couldn’t get any more information out of her beyond what she just said.  Perhaps I had to be thankful that she at least remembered seeing my sister’s face under such chaotic circumstances.  Then a man wearing puttees and khaki national uniform walked towards us and joined our circle.  His daughter was also in her first year at Jogakuin College.  He grew concerned when she didn’t come home that night so he came from Kure to search for her.  None of the students knew of this man’s daughter’s whereabouts.  It was natural.  After all, it had only been six days since the school year began.  The first-year students barely had the time to learn their classmates’ names, much less get to know the whole student body.  I tried to encourage the man:  “They say our sister fled with some others who were wounded.  Perhaps they were together, and I’m sure there were some more that escaped elsewhere.”  “If they fled, where do you think they headed?”  “I’m guessing they ran away from the city center”, I pointed to the north.  My sympathy went out to him as I watched the man walk away in search of his daughter.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe decided to go back to our home and headed towards Nagarekawa.  As usual, burned bodies lay about everywhere, but this time we noticed many bodies in the fire cisterns.  They must have escaped initially but lost their way out when the smoke and fire engulfed them.  On the road were many dead bodies that were frozen on their hands and knees, telling the stories of struggle as they used their last ounce of strength to escape the fires.  They looked like mannequins painted black.  Junko had become numb to the sight of dead bodies by then: she wasn’t shocked each time she saw one.  The inside of the Hiroshima NHK Broadcast Center was also burned black with a few dead bodies inside.  The Nagarekawa Church was now a hollow frame.  The charnel on the 3rd floor of the tower to the left of the entrance used to house the bones of our stillborn baby sister.  Had she been alive, she would have been named Aiko.  I thought of how her bones must have flown away, as the soul of baby Aiko was cradled by Mother’s departed soul.  I remembered how when I was young, Mother would take me up the dark staircase and we would put a single carnation in the handle of the metal door where Aiko’s bones were stored.  How Mother’s heart must have ached over this child, too!</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe walked down Nagarekawa Street due south, crossed the yard of Yamanaka Middle School for women, and arrived at the ruins of our home.  The front gate and the frame of the piano stood as a reminder that only 24 hours ago, our house used to be there.  I expected to see dead bodies of our neighbors, but they were all buried under debris and couldn’t be seen.  We went to the area where Mother could have been yesterday and moved around some shingles, but we didn’t find anything that resembled a dead body.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThen I found some dead bodies about 20 meters northwest of where I was digging.  I went over and looked at their teeth but they also didn’t resemble that of Mother’s.  (I had searched for Mother’s body up to about 20 meters away from where her body was finally found.  Mother’s soul must have been calling out to my sister and me.)  We returned to the ruin of our house and wrote on the concrete surface of the fire cistern:  “Father suffered serious injuries.  Yoshihide and Junko are well and headed to Ushita.” (Mr. Sawano’s home was in Ushita and we had planned on evacuating there.)  I picked up a teacup that had survived the fire.  It was the teacup that I had been drinking from at the time of the explosion.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe left our home and went to Hiroshima University.  We entered Father’s lab.  In the dark room there remained a metal helmet and a charred typewriter.  I picked up a piece of coal and wrote on the stone wall of the entrance:  “Yoshikuni Hiraiwa is badly injured; Yoshihide and Junko are well” After I put the piece of coal down, Mr. Nakane, the man who helped Father yesterday, appeared.  “What about your mother?” he asked with concern.  I thanked him for yesterday and told him that my mother was missing.  He told me that he took my father to Oko Grade School.  We headed there in a hurry.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere were many people at Oko Grade School.  Some were uninjured and seemed quite healthy.  The roof of the building was still intact but all of the windows were blown out by the blast.  The rooms were full and the refugees overflowed out into the hallways.  I didn’t know if it had anything to do with the passage of time from the bombing, but the rooms were permeated with a unique stench that was not the usual body odor.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe peeked into each classroom.  There were very few patients with surface wounds: most of the people there were burn victims and many were nearly naked.  Although they were accommodated, it didn’t seem as if they had been given proper treatment for their burns.  They all had the same swollen faces with slits for eyes.  We could barely tell apart the sexes but it was impossible to recognize their identities.  Father hadn’t suffer any burns and he had been wearing a yukata  (although it was torn): so we looked for a man in a yukata. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFather was accommodated in a classroom with tatami mats facing the school yard.  He looked over at us and I could see relief in his eyes.  We ran up to him and held his hand.  The first thing he asked was about Mother.  He was terribly worried about her.  Although I hadn’t found her body, judging by the way of things, the chance of her survival was very slim.  For a moment I hesitated to tell him so.  Father saw the tears welling up in Junko’s eyes as she held onto his hand.  He seemed to take in the situation.  “I couldn’t save her,” I said.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHe let go of my hand and started to weep as he called out her name, “Michiko… Michiko…”  For the first time I felt the pain of losing Mother.  Junko stood up and brought a wet cloth to wipe Father’s face, hands and feet.  I was watching my tough father cry for the first time in my life.  I could see his strength waning.  I realized that from now on, I had to lead the family.  I shall never cry again over losing Mother, at least not in front of anyone, I resolved to myself.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI looked around the darkening classroom.  There were about 30 people being accommodated there.  The only person without injuries was Junko.  A lone army soldier walked by and counted the number of wounded.  They put Father in the category of light injuries.  Things were in such disarray that even those who couldn’t walk were put into the light injury category as long as they weren’t bleeding or burned badly.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSuddenly, we heard a high-pitched shout: “Mommy, Mommy.  Hurry up, the train’s leaving.”  It was the voice belonging to a girl of about 14 or 15, lying near us.  In her dim consciousness, she must have been having visions of a peaceful day in the past when she traveled with her mother.  The soldier who was making the rounds found a grass mat from somewhere and covered her nearly naked body with it.  But the abrasive surface of the mat must have been painful against her broken skin; she took it off immediately.  I put it back over her body a few times.  After a while, I noticed she had stopped throwing off the mat.  The soldier came in and looked at her.  “She’s dead,” he said simply, and carried her out with the help of another soldier.  Her space was filled immediately with another patient who had been out in the hallway.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was unclear whether there weren’t any doctors available or if there was no way to treat such terrible burns: either way, while I stayed at Oko Grade School, I did not see a single medical officer, medical orderly, or nurse.  Most patients didn’t even have the strength left to shoo the flies away, and the injured that could barely walk were taking care of the immobilized.  There were many who were incontinent but nobody was around to clean up after them.  Right next to the mess would be another groaning patient.  The dead bodies that were lying around in the hallway and schoolyard were gathered in a corner of the yard by the soldiers.  They stacked the bodies up, poured gasoline on, and burned them.  Without even being identified, many people became muen-botoke .  When there was a lull in the wind the classroom was filled with an intolerable stench.  Then I thought I smelled something similar to broiled fish.  I realized it was the smell of cremated bodies.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe second dark night without electricity arrived.  They had even put out the fire of cremation.  I don’t know if they were worried about being air raided.  I told Father about what I had been doing since I left him.  He asked about what could have caused this devastation, and what sort of bomb was dropped, but I had no answers for him.  “I wish I could have taken care of Mother until she died peacefully on a tatami mat,” I said softly, almost to myself.  “It would have been much harder to see her die in peaceful times,” he replied weakly.  It sounded like he was trying to comfort and convince himself.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhenever we heard planes in the distance the refugees would swallow their breath and fall silent.  The stars in the night sky beyond the windows of the classrooms twinkled unsuitably beautifully for such a tragic scene.  Compared to camping out at Mt.Hiji the night before, the classroom with a roof and tatami was heaven.  Fatigue since last night overcame me and pulled me into a deep sleep.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the brightness of the morning of August 8, I looked around and noticed that about 10 people in the classroom had died overnight.  Once again the soldiers carried away the bodies and brought in more patients from the hallway.  However, this time there were less waiting out in the hallway and the room was now less crowded.  Father’s back seemed to be bothering him and he kept saying that he wanted to lie down on a futon.  Junko and I decided that we should ask Mr. Sawano, who had some of our belongings, or Mr. Inoue in Onaga-cho (currently working as a high school principal in Gion) to help us.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe dead bodies in the city were emitting a terrible stench as they were starting to rot.  We didn’t see many injured survivors.  Most of them must have died.  There were a few wounded soldiers next to the Sentei Garden (Shukkeien).  The oldest among them yelled proudly, “Hey, civilian, give us some water.  We’re fighting a war for you!”  He was the epitome of a fallen soldier.  It was a pitiful sight.  Most people were occupied with their worries over their friends and families, and glanced over but walked past the soldiers without helping.  There was a boy lying on his side.  Passersby were giving him words of encouragement.  I got the impression that, in general, the boys and girls in their low teens were handling the situation more maturely than the brawny soldiers.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMr. Sawano’s residence was on a hill in Ushita and had a great view.  The house was damaged slightly, but Mrs. Sawano and the family were safe.  We compared stories and realized the huge difference between our views and experiences.  I told Mrs. Sawano that our father survived but we lost our mother.  She cried as she listened.  When I asked her if she would take my father in for a while, she gladly accepted.  We opened our chest of drawers made of paulownia wood.  We found clothes that Mother had neatly put in there.  It was so typical of Mother, who always nagged us to keep things in order.  Junko bent over the drawer and bawled.  We pulled out Father’s yukata and obi , and Mother’s favorite shawl.  I stuck my face in her shawl and smelled her scent.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe returned to Oko Grade School and gave Father the yukata to change into.  I covered his belly with Mother’s shawl and watched him get lost in his thoughts as he fixed his gaze upon it.  In the afternoon, we heard that refugees were being housed at the Army Quarantine Station in Ninoshima Island, and I departed in a hurry without taking anything.  I arrived in Ujina on the crowded street along the streetcar line.  The buildings in the area seemed to have survived the blast.  The streetcars were left on the rails where they were when they lost power.  They served as convenient shelters for those whose homes burned down.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNames of people, accommodated in Ninoshima Island, were posted on a list at the Army Ship Troop Station.  It was a tiring task to go down the list of names written in sloppy order.  Some of the names were in katakana ; the victims must not have had enough strength to spell out the kanji  for the record keeper.  I checked from edge to edge twice, as if I was checking the results of school entrance exams, but I did not see my family name.  Many times, I asked the soldiers, “Are there any people accommodated in Ninoshima other than the ones listed here?”  “There may be more than what is listed here; we transported one after another with the Daihatsu (landing boat).  The names that we know of are listed here,” they answered.  I wanted to get to Ninoshima just to make sure that Mother wasn’t there.  I asked them to put me on the ship to Ninoshima but they told me that civilians without a proper purpose were not allowed.  I also heard that they housed many injured over at the Ono Army Hospital in the west.  But I couldn’t imagine that Mother would have fled in the opposite direction of our house from where she was; I didn’t feel like going to check at the Ono Army Hospital.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI returned drained to Oko Grade School and reported to Father.  I laid my weary body down and noticed that, unlike the day before, there were many people visiting in the classroom.  The visitors checked the faces of the patients one by one.  They too were looking for their missing family members.  People seemed to gravitate towards the area where we stayed since we were relatively healthy looking.  My father, who had been staying there right after the bomb, was being bombarded with questions.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBut most of the questions he couldn’t answer.  We didn’t know the names of people lying next to us.  Their faces all looked the same and their clothes were burned off.  Under these extreme circumstances, he didn’t have enough energy to pay attention to, much less remember, what sorts of people were accommodated and how they had died.  This time it was my turn to be asked the same exact question that I had just asked the marine soldiers in Ujina.  I felt my vitality drain.  I can’t run out of strength now; I’ve got much left to do.  I must accomplish my tasks, one by one, I told myself.  Father had lost control over his whole lower body, and even turning over in bed required my help.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the morning of August 9, I went to Hiroshima University and borrowed a cart, which was a precious commodity at the time. (I have no recollection of who I asked, or how.)  Several times it was almost stolen while I left the cart in the schoolyard.  Around the same time, Professor Inoue (graduate of Hiroshima University Zoology), who was teaching at the Public Instructor’s College, had come to visit Father.  He said that it was too big of a task for me to carry Father on a cart to Ushita, considering the severity of my injury.  He sent four students from his school to help, along with a futon and umbrella.  We spread the futon on the large cart, laid Father on top of that, and pulled carefully over the bumpy road littered with shingles.  Father was seeing the scorched field for the first time and opened his eyes wide in surprise.  I think the gravity of the situation finally sank in.  We laid him down on a futon at the Sawano residence, and I thanked all the students from the bottom of my heart.  I asked for their names, but they all just smiled.  They all wore Khaki uniforms with combat hats.  I noticed a small blister from a burn on one of the students’ faces.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDr. Masumoto, my father’s colleague from Hiroshima University, came to visit (Dr. Masumoto had lost his wife in the bombing.)   “Seems as though we’ve both got maggots,” he said in his frank manner, as he entered the room.  He reported the news regarding the faculty and staff.  They were planning on holding a faculty meeting to discuss their future plans at school.  Once Father heard this, he troubled us by insisting that we hire a car to take him to the University.  He hadn’t yet grasped that the whole city had burned down.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe Chiba Prefecture Sakura Regiment that was stationed at Hachihonmatsu came to Hiroshima on a rescue mission.  The headquarters of several military companies was stationed at the Sawano residence.  The company leader was an old First Lieutenant from Kyushu.  The three platoon leaders were Second Lieutenants in their early 20s, just graduated from military academy in July.  Their uniforms had no trace of having been in actual combat; they looked like they should be getting in a scrum and singing their school song.  Most of the soldiers were from old town in Tokyo.  They had passed the draft examination in February and March and joined the army, just like I had.  I was filled with nostalgia as I heard them speak in Tokyo dialect.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe soldiers in the Company Command Group seemed to have been the students who excelled most.  When they learned that my father was a university professor, they all treated him with respect.  I immediately became friendly with the three Second Lieutenants.  They told me lots of news: the Imperial Headquarters announced on August 7 that a new type of bomb was dropped over Hiroshima: the same bomb was dropped on Nagasaki just this morning.  They also updated me on the condition of the war with the Soviets.  I could feel with my whole being that the war was coming to an end, and yet, I was unable to ask the crucial question-when.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“I heard that this new type of bomb is called the atomic bomb.  They were saying something about the gamma waves.  What is a gamma wave?” asked one of the Second Lieutenants, after finding out that I used to be an engineer student.  Having spent most of my time working in the Student Mobilization and not getting to study much, I had no way to answer him.  All I could remember was it was a type of radiation emitted by radium.  I remembered reading in a book when I was in the 8 grade (in 1939) that in the near future there would be an atomic gun.  I wondered if this is what was developed and used on us.  Once the government declared that this bomb dropped by the Americans was indeed an atomic bomb, false rumors spread across town.  People said the Japanese had also dropped this bomb on a B-29 in Marianna.  This was about the time when people started calling the atomic bomb “Pika-Don.”  Since the power was still out, the public couldn’t listen to the radio.  Naturally, newspapers weren’t being printed in the city either, and rumors flew rampant across the city.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy sister, who had been taking off from work, returned to the Army Provisions Depot at Koi Grade School.  In between taking care of Father, I wandered out into the city to search for Mother.  The Second Lieutenants of the Sakura Regiment offered to help, but I didn’t want to take them away from their soldier duties for a private purpose, and I politely declined.  Over and over, I searched every refugee camp on the eastern side of Hiroshima as long as my strength lasted.  I checked the ruin of Fukuya Department Store even though I knew they only housed soldiers there.  Every time I passed by a dead body that could possibly be my mother’s, I opened its mouth to check its teeth.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA few days after the bombing, a temporary post office was opened near Hiroshima Station.  I heard they were giving out postcards for free, so I sent a postcard to Mother’s family in Suginami-ku of Tokyo.  On it, I wrote: “Father: suffered serious injuries.  Mother: missing (hope of survival; slim to none.)  Yoshihide: suffered minor injuries.  Junko: well.  Kiyoko: missing (possibly alive).”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSuddenly I became worried about Kiyoko.  I went to the scorched grounds of Jogakuin and looked at the dead bodies.  Although her classmate said that she escaped, judging by the fact that she had not come to Ushita, it was possible she was badly hurt and died without anyone knowing.  I tried to erase the ominous thoughts from my head.  One day, Hiroshi Suura, an old classmate from Hiroshima University Middle School (currently professor at Engineering Department of Japan University), came to visit me.  We rejoiced over each other’s survival.  I told him about my mother and what she had been doing before she was missing.  The talk I had with him became a key to finding Mother’s body later on.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA few days before August 15, when the war ended, Kiyoko appeared out of nowhere.  “You idiot!  If you were alive all this time, where have you been?” I shouted at her while she stood at the front door smiling.  “Now, now, you can’t expect her to tell you her story standing here.  Let’s go upstairs and show your father Kiyoko’s face,” Mrs. Sawano interjected.  I took her upstairs to Father.  I was still angry and was about to give her a piece of my mind when Father said uncharacteristically calmly, “Yoshihide, it’s alright.  Kiyoko, I’m glad you’re back.”  The story that she told through her sobs is as follows.  When the bomb was dropped, the morning service at Jogakuin had just come to an end and some of her classmates were already outside.  Kiyoko was standing by a wall between two windows so she didn’t suffer burns from the beam.  She rushed to her classroom and grabbed her kit bag.  (This detail seemed strange to me and I asked her many times if she hadn’t actually carried her kit bag with her when she was in the chapel.  I couldn’t imagine that any of the school buildings would be intact after the blast.  It would have been impossible for her to retrieve her kit bag from her classroom, but she insisted that she wasn’t mistaken.  She said that her salary from the Student Mobilization was in her bag.)  She fled with some of her wounded friends and arrived at the training hall of her old school Hiroshima Kenjo High School for women.  There she helped take care of the injured.  After a few days when she went to the ruins of our house, she saw my writing on the fire cistern.  She was relieved to find out that Father, Junko and I were alive, and returned to the training hall where she continued to care for the injured.  Finally they released her and now she was here.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA relief team arrived from Okayama Medical University.  They visited and treated wounded faculty and staff members of the colleges and universities in Hiroshima.  They came to see my father. Although the scrapes on his lower body were infected in 28 places, other than that Father didn’t have any visible injuries.  The medical staff tapped Father’s body in places with a small rubber mallet usually used for detecting beriberi and said, “His life is not in jeopardy but it seems his vertebrae are misaligned.  You should take him to a specialist as soon as possible.”  Anyone with common sense could figure that out.  I asked them if Father would be able to walk again.  They gave me a rather pessimistic answer.  “There is a possibility he might.”  I was disappointed.  My mood became gloomy as I imagined our days to come, how I would have to give up my studies and take a job, in order to support and care for my paralyzed father.  If only Mother was alive, she would help me through this dilemma by being able to talk about things, I thought.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFinally after about ten days after the bombing, I stopped seeing injured victims lying around in the city.  It must take them many days to collect and dispose of tens of thousands of bodies, I thought to myself.  Most of the relief teams who came from the outskirts of the city seemed to be focusing their efforts on collecting the bodies floating down the rivers.  I walked over the Aioi Bridge several times, near the epicenter.  Each time, I would stop in the middle of the bridge and watch the relief teams pull out bodies.  Sometimes I would get closer and watch intensely to see if any of the bodies were that of Mother.  Once I saw a Lockheed P-38 Lightning plane on a scout mission and I stood there angrily glaring at it.  A police officer, who saw me just standing there, yelled at me for my foolishness.  In the daytime the city was populated with survivors looking for the missing, but when night fell Hiroshima literally became a ghost town.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the late afternoon of August 15, a Model 95 Reconnaissance Hydro Airplane bearing the Japanese rising sun logo, flew low over the city and disbursed bills.  It was the first Japanese Navy plane I had seen in a long time.  On the straw paper bills were a mimeographed headline that read, “The Holy Nation is immortal: it will fight with its people.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nCompared to the bills I had seen many times disbursed by B-29s, this bill was quite shabby.  The message seemed quite inappropriate for the citizens of Hiroshima, but I didn’t waste much time mulling over it.  Once I got back to Ushita, I noticed the soldiers seemed to be anxious.  According to the report from the Army, the war had ended.  Junko had also heard the same news at the Army Provisions Depot (factory for military food cans).  So we lost, I realized.  Although I had been expecting it, still my energy was drained.  I remember Junko and Mrs. Sawano saying in defense, “Japan will never lose a war.”  It was either on that day or the next that the power turned back on and we were able to listen to the news over the radio.  They reported on the state of our nation.  People were informed that the blackouts were cancelled and the city lights were turned on again at night.  It was finally starting to feel like humans actually lived on this land.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“The American Army is going to land for invasion.  The devilish U.S. soldiers are arriving.  The Japanese military will provide trucks so women and children should escape into the mountains.” this was what was said at the Army Provisions Depot where Junko worked.  Father and I debated whether we should evacuate my sisters into the mountains.  Father, who had lived in the United States for two years, had a different point of view.  “It’s one thing if the soldiers had been fighting us on the battle grounds like they have been in Europe.  In that case, there would be a high emotional charge and it would be difficult to predict their actions.  But the Americans are coming in peace.  They won’t hurt us.  Let’s keep our family together.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was around this time that the survivors who seemed to be healthy started to experience severe dehydration.  Most of them had uncontrollable diarrhea.  No one knew if it had anything to do with “Pika-Don,” or if it was an epidemic.  People lived in fear of the unknown disease.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSome time after the war, Reverend Omura from Asagaya Church visited us.  We were surprised by his sudden visit.  He had come from afar, taking one dreadful train after another, and brought some food as well as precious injections of vitamins and glucose.  Without delay, I sterilized a syringe and prepared a shot for Father.  “Have you ever given a shot to another person before?” Father asked in doubt.  “It’s O.K.  I’ve done it before,” muffling my words I said, and poked the needle under his skin.  It must have hurt quite a bit, and from then on he never let me give him another shot.  The truth was, other than someone severely injured, my father was the first person I had given a shot to under normal circumstances.  That evening, Rev. Omura led our family and Mrs. Sawano in a small memorial for Mother.  In my heart I was weeping, but I kept my resolution and didn’t show my tears.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe next morning Rev. Omura was headed to see his friend from Asagaya Church, who had evacuated into the mountains of Hiroshima prefecture.  I accompanied him part of the way and went to see my sister Aiko (Aiko Fischer), who had been staying in Tojo-cho of Hiroshima Prefecture.  Unlike the time I visited her two weeks ago, my stride was heavy.  When I arrived at the temple, a boy from Aiko’s class jumped up and clung to me.  The last time when I arrived with food, the children had begged me to tell them stories of the air battles during the Tokyo bombings.  As I told stories of enemy planes being shot down left and right, their little minds must have imagined me as the pilot that was doing the shooting.  Perhaps in their eyes I was a hero.  I went to see my sister’s teacher, Ms. Hiraiwa (coincidentally the same name as ours), and reported that our mother was missing.  I told her that I would like to take Aiko to Tokyo eventually, but until then I needed Ms. Hiraiwa to take care of her.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSoon, someone sent for Aiko and she entered the room.  She had just turned 10 years old and had a huge smile on her face.  She had not grasped the situation yet.  I searched for words and said this much:  “Mommy went to heaven after the bombing on August 6.  Daddy was hurt.  Our home in Hiroshima burned down, so we decided to move to Tokyo.  Once things get settled, I’ll come and get you, so until then please be a good girl and stay with Ms. Hiraiwa.”  Aiko listened with tears in her eyes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“You can stay and grow vegetables with me until then, O.K.?” said Ms. Hiraiwa kindly.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was relieved soon after when I saw Aiko play with her friends.  I knew that she would survive.  That night we slept next to each other in a small room in the main temple building.  As I watched her sleep, her face so innocent, I became concerned with the struggles we were going to face in the days to come and had a hard time falling asleep.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the Geibi Line train on the way home, all I heard people talking about was “Pika-Don.”  I eavesdropped on the two women sitting in front of me.  “They said you weren’t supposed to give them water, but now I’m hearing that you’re supposed to give them a whole bunch of water so that they can detoxify through sweating and urinating,” they spoke.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI interjected, deliberately speaking slowly in a Tokyo accent.  I taught them the difference between toxins and radiation.  I also informed them of the dangers of giving water to burn victims because of the compromise in their excretion system.  They struggled to understand.  My medical knowledge was not much deeper than common sense, but I didn’t want people to believe demagoguery and waste precious lives that could be saved.  I explained over and over and said, “I’m just a medical student, but if you don’t believe me, please check with a doctor.”  I am suspicious that these false rumors had somehow contributed to the rising death toll in the end of August to the beginning of September.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was no purpose to stay in Hiroshima forever, and I decided to return to Tokyo on August 29.  I glanced over at the beautiful Mt. Fuji from the window of the train on the morning of August 30.  Suddenly, when we came by the Rokkyo Bridge over Tama River, a B-29 flew low overhead and startled me.  The plane looked huge up close.  It was dropping goods from colorful parachutes over the P.O.W. camp in Kawasaki.  This was the day McArthur landed in Atsugi.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy aunt was surprised to see how pale I was and took me to the Tsuzuki clinic of Tokyo University the next day.  Dr. Tsuzuki had discovered and was studying atomic bomb disease after encountering a mysterious death at Tokyo University Hospital.  An actress by the name of Keiko Sonoi was in the bombing while on tour in Hiroshima with the Sadao Maruyama Theater Company.  After she returned to Tokyo, she had to be admitted to the hospital despite her lack of surface wounds. She died a few days later.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was examined by a doctor who seemed to be an assistant professor, and was questioned by several interns.  It seemed more like an interrogation rather than a medical consultation.  They asked for information regarding where I lived, the clothes I was wearing, and the actions I took following the blast.  When they learned that I was inside a house, they even had me draw a diagram.  One of the interns brought out a map of Hiroshima.  On it they had drawn circles marking every 100 meters from the epicenter.  It was a map that came from the Army Staff Officer Headquarters and seemed to be printed from an aerial photograph.  There was an etching on the corner that read “5th American Air Force.”  We measured the distance from the epicenter to my house at 1,280 meters.  They took a bunch of blood samples and plucked my hair from my head and other body parts.  They took my urine sample and an X-ray.  The whole exam took about three hours.  I remember seeing them record that I was the 28th patient who arrived from Hiroshima.  Then it was time to see the assistant professor again.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Would you like to be hospitalized?” he asked me when he saw my face, pale from drawing so much blood.   “The hospital is having difficulty with supplying enough food for the patients, so if you can commute, that shall be fine.  But I would like for you to tell me if you feel worse.  I will arrange for your hospitalization.  You’ll be admitted as a comp patient.”  I supposed he was saying that they’ll waive the medical bills if I returned.  They didn’t want their precious guinea pig to escape.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI commuted twice a week.  The second time I went to the clinic they told me that my white blood cell count was 3800.  They estimated that it had been even lower after the bombing.  They said something about my hemoglobin being this-and-that, and I took notes in my handbook, but since I’ve lost the handbook, I cannot remember the numbers.  In the end, they even took a sample of my semen.  One day in early September, I almost fainted from an anemic spell on the way to the clinic.  My aunt and relatives grew concerned for me and they selected the most nutritional foods that were available in the poor marketplace.  Gradually I regained my health and vitality.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe people who had evacuated into the countryside began to return to the scorched fields of Tokyo.  The young men who took off their military garb began to attend church and the services became lively.  That September, I was assigned to be a church school instructor and stood in front of the children with bandages still around my neck.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe Makurazaki Typhoon that hit western Japan beat down on the already-destroyed city of Hiroshima.  The rains washed over the ground and unearthed many dead bodies that had been buried.  My old classmate from middle school, Hiroshi Suura, visited my family in Ushita to give us the news that he found a body that could be Mother’s.  I’m not sure how he figured out that the decomposed body was my mother’s.  Perhaps Mother’s soul, having been frustrated by my failure to find her body when I was so close, called out to Hiroshi.  My uncle had gone to Hiroshima to pick up my sisters.  He and Junko went to the site to identify Mother’s body.  There had been a broken water pipe that saved one of her getas and a part of her mompe pants  from being burned.  They judged by the strap on the geta and the fabric of the monpe pants that it was indeed Mother.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe color of her monpe pants had been faded to almost white but the faint pattern was still recognizable.  The strap on the geta was one that had belonged to Kiyoko (to this day, we have kept this geta).  My uncle snapped a picture of the site.  The stench was awful and they couldn’t give Mother a proper burial at the time.  They put her remains in a water jar with some sand, and buried it temporarily in the bomb shelter at our house.  The time was the beginning of October, 1945.  (Later I showed this photograph to a doctor friend, who gave the verdict that Mother had died immediately.  If he had said so in an attempt to make me feel better, it worked.)  On the 5 of October, another typhoon landed on Japan.  Right after the typhoon passed, my uncle brought Kiyoko and Aiko back to Tokyo.  I had also arrived in Tokyo on the same day after picking up my grandmother from Yamanashi.  Aiko saw the scorched fields of Tokyo and remarked that it looked the same as Hiroshima.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I was leaving Hiroshima, Kiyoko was suffering from terrible diarrhea.  Any time someone wanted to go to the bathroom, Kiyoko was in there.  At one time I even thought that she might die.  The day after she arrived, I took her at once to Tokyo University Hospital.  I remember Kiyoko was the 36th patient from Hiroshima.  Just as they had done to me, the interns began their interrogation all together.  Jogakuin had only been 1,100 meters away at the time the bomb had been dropped.  Upon examination, we learned her white blood cell count was at 3,200, and the doctor estimated that it had been as low as 1,000 ten days after the bombing.  The doctor was collecting studies of the patients to release at a surgeon’s conference that would be held in January of 1946 in Atami.  Since Kiyoko hadn’t suffered any surface injuries, they told her to come and get checked once a month.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAbout half of my wounds had healed, but the areas that got infected took much longer.  The skin around the wound on my neck had remained open and I wondered how it would heal.  Eventually, it turned into a keloid scar.  I tried to burn it with silver nitrate.  Not only did the scar not get any smaller, but instead it started to puff up.  Once it got colder, the infections subsided, and by the end of December I was able to take the bandages off.  The wound on my shin healed the slowest. Some skin finally grew over it in February.  In the beginning of December, when I saw the assistant professor, he smiled and said to me, “You no longer show any symptoms of the atomic bomb disease.  You’re of no use to our medical study.”  I was glad.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt the end of October, my aunt and I went to pick up Father and Junko.  We had been waiting for the Sanyo Honsen Rail Road to reopen ever since the typhoons.  I will not forget the day on November 3, 1945, the Meiji holiday (currently renamed Cultural Day), when we gave Mother a proper burial.  We left the Sawano residence in Ushita early morning.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThree months earlier, when I roamed the streets of Hiroshima, the Nagarekawa Road was crowded with people looking for their missing family members.  Now it seemed they had collected the bodies that could be identified and the streets were lonely.  Once in a while we would see dead bodies with white bones sticking out of the rubble.  In the 3 months that I was gone, they had cleared the wider asphalt roads of debris, enough for a car to drive through.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe city, having been washed down by two typhoons, no longer stank like it did after the bombing.  The Japanese Imperial Government that used the atomic bomb as a reason for defeat had announced that the soil of Hiroshima would be barren for 75 years, but already you could see some grass growing in places.  We walked by Sanyo Middle School and headed towards our house from Chuo Street.  The debris in our neighborhood had not been cleared and it looked basically the same as when I had left.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn from the entrance to our house, where there used to be a small room, was a mound of dirt with a single piece of wood stuck in it to mark Mother’s temporary grave site.  Junko and I stood in front of the mound and bowed our heads in silence.  Mother had been waiting all alone for me to come and get her for such a long time.  I had failed to find her on August 6 because I didn’t have enough strength.  I closed my eyes and called to her in my heart:  “Mother, I’ve made you wait for so long.  Yoshihide and Junko are here to come and get you.  Let’s go back to Tokyo together.”  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe dug the dirt with a shovel we brought along and found the water jar that contained her remains.  We made some chopsticks out of slender pieces of wood and little by little dug her bones out of the sand.  We found 2 sheets of burned tin and gathered anything that would burn, like pieces of lumber and telephone poles stuck in the dirt.  Once the fire was big enough, we tossed in an almost-intact rib bone.  Then we threw in bones from her legs and arms.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the beginning we used the chopsticks to dig into the sand and throw the bones into the fire, but once the chopsticks broke we just used our hands.  I found the top of her skull.  I took it in my hand and gazed at it a while.  I thought about how Mother used to rub her cheek on mine when I was a child.  Then we found a rather large piece of muscle that survived the fire.  It seemed to be her calf muscle.  The blood-less muscle was almost clear and whiter than chicken breast.  We dumped the rest of the contents out of the water jar and searched desperately for any other remains.  I didn’t want to leave any body part.  From the bottom of the jar emerged a piece of intestine about a meter in length.  I looked for her teeth but did not find them.  After combing through it, I put the sand back in the water jar.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe wind picked up and the fire burning Mother turned into a brisk blaze.  It seemed to symbolize Mother’s joy as she arose to heaven.  When we started the cremation we didn’t see anyone in the vicinity, but after a few hours, a middle-aged man, dressed in khaki national uniform, approached.  He stated an address and asked where it was.  I remember it being pretty far from where we were.  I tried to give him directions, but the town had lost all its landmarks.  I pointed in the direction and gave him an approximate distance.  He told us the name of the family he was looking for, but I couldn’t say I knew them; it wasn’t like we lived in a small village.  He asked many questions about what happened during the bombing and, unfulfilled, finally left.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI think we cremated Mother for about three hours.  The bones were turning red and the smell of burning flesh had disappeared.  We poured some water from a fire cistern over the fire.  We gathered the white bones among the smoldering black coal.  We put them in an empty can that we brought along.  It felt like we let the fire burn for quite a long time and yet the intestine was still intact.  We gathered the coal on the tin sheets and put it in the water jar.  Then we buried the water jar back into the dirt of our bomb shelter.  Then we used the shovel to poke around the ruins of the house but nothing worth keeping emerged.  The frame of the piano and bicycle that remained the day after the bombing was gone.  I suppose someone had some use for them and took them away.  I washed off in the water of the fire cistern but I could not erase the smell of death from my hands.  I didn’t feel like eating the lunch that Mrs. Sawano packed for us.  By the time we were done, the sun had moved lower over the western sky.  With both of my hands I carefully carried Mother’s bones, wrapped in white cloth.  We said our last goodbyes to the home to which we would never return and walked away.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe ran into Reverend Tanimoto by the Tsuruhane Shrine.  “We just picked up Mother,” I said.  He got off his bicycle and prayed in silence.  When we arrived at the Sawano’s home, Father welcomed us back warmly.  I was startled by his unusual manner; normally he didn’t greet his children with kindness.  I realized he was waiting for something, and immediately I got my knees in proper form.  “I’ve returned with Mother,” I said and held out the white bundle with both hands.  Father received it with both hands and said softly, “Welcome home.”  Mrs. Sawano brought some flowers and I intended to put Mother’s remains on the chest of drawers along with the flowers.  But then Father said, “Please leave her here with me tonight.”  In my grown-up eyes, Mother and Father didn’t seem to be a very loving couple, but that day I realized that Father loved Mother deeply in his own way.  Now that Mother was dead I was seeing Father’s affection for her for the first time.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFor a few days I ran around tidying up odds and ends.  Father handed me some money to buy tickets to Tokyo.  I saw that he had given me too much, and I tried to give him back the extra money when he said, “I’m going back to Tokyo with Mother.  Go and buy 2nd class tickets” (back then, the train tickets were divided into 1st, 2nd and 3rd class.)  The Sawano family helped us put Father on a cart lined with a futon and then he was taken to Hiroshima Station.  Father had not been outside since his trip from Oko Grade School and once again, he looked around in astonishment at how comdetely the city had been destroyed.  He tightly held Mother’s ashes in his hands sticking out of his coat.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe train on Sanyo Line went slowly, since the rails had not been repaired completely since the typhoons.  We had to fight a mass of rowdy people when we switched trains in Osaka.  I carried Father (and Mother) on my back and finally grabbed a seat in desperation and sat him down.   There are no more air raids.  All we have to do is to wait for this train to arrive in Tokyo, I thought to myself, and fell asleep in the aisle.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMother’s funeral was held at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, November 20, 1945.  The service was held at the Asagaya Church in Suginami-ku of Tokyo, where our legal residence was.  I had bought a ceramic urn and gathered the family the night before to do a “bone-picking ceremony.”  The relatives transferred Mother’s bones and ashes from the can to the urn.  Rev. Omura and Principal Matsumoto from Jogakuin attended the memorial and gave orations.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFather, who could barely sit up, much less walk, sat in an armchair throughout the funeral.  We sang Mother’s favorite song “Do not wait for the rain to stop and sun to shine…” (Hymn 472).  When Aiko stood in front of Mother’s picture to say her parting speech, all the tears that I had pushed back started to flow at once.  Finally in this time of peace I felt that Mother had returned to heaven.  After the funeral, I took her ashes from the platform and gave it to Father, who in turn gave it back to me. “I’m going to bury her now,” I said.  “Yes.  Go and do so,” he replied, wiping his eyes.  In his heart, he must have been saying his final goodbye to Mother.  That afternoon I went to the Aoyama graveyard and buried Mother, and Father’s brother, Yasunobu Hiraiwa, who died in the bombing when he happened to be visiting Hiroshima on August 6.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt the end of November, Father was admitted into Tokyo University Orthopedics Hospital.  Since September, I had been taking blood tests regularly.  By this time the doctor had given me the verdict that I did not show signs of atomic bomb disease.  Upon examination, Father was also diagnosed to be free of atomic bomb disease and he received chin-up rehabilitation for his dislocated vertebrae.  By the time April rolled around in 1946, he was walking again.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy wound healed by February of 1946, but I received cosmetic surgery on the keloid scar on my neck in August of 1947.  I went to the Kawakita Hospital in Suginami-ku.  My surgeon was Dr. Hattori, who worked at the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital on August 6.  The surgery seemed simple enough: all they did was remove the keloid scar and sew up the hole.  Unfortunately as soon as they took out the sutures it just turned into another keloid scar.  They said that they would probably have to do a skin graft from my arm to get rid of the scar.  I figured since I am a man and there was no limitation in my neck movements, I would opt out on having another surgery.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nToday I am relatively healthy.  In fact, I’m so healthy that I almost feel guilty when I see people in Hiroshima suffering from the aftereffects.  Out of all my family members, I would have been exposed to the most amount of radiation.  Once I started working, my boss, who was concerned about the aftereffects of radiation exposure, took me to a hospital and had my blood tested, but they didn’t find anything wrong (this was in 1952).</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn late 1955, I was transferred to Hiroshima.  I visited the Atomic Bomb Museum several times, but their exhibits cannot begin to convey the misery of that time.  In 1957 they passed some law and I received an A-bomb Health Book.  Immediately after, ABCC started sending people over to my home to try to get me to come in for an examination.  Each time I declined firmly, saying that I had been tested many times in a Japanese hospital.  I gave them the necessary information so that they could look up my medical records at Tokyo University Hospital.  I have not received treatment using the A-bomb Health Book since 1960.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEver since the thorough physical exam I had in 1966, not only have I not had an abnormal result in my annual exams, but I have been enjoying above-average health.  I feel blessed that I have been able to continue serving as a CS instructor since 1945.  On October 2, 1967, Father made his transition after suffering from cirrhosis of the liver.  In concurrence with his will, we asked for an autopsy.  They found some cells that showed early signs of cancer but said that with the medical knowledge of the day, it was impossible to tell whether the cancer had anything to do with atomic bomb disease.  When I got married, I became troubled by the thought of passing on defective genes to my unborn children.  Fortunately, God blessed me with three healthy children.  My oldest boy, who was born in Hiroshima, presently serves as the chairman of the Junior High School Compassion Group at church.  He has grown up to be of service as the 4th generation Protestant of Japanese Christians.  I am filled with gratitude.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen will peace arrive?</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt has been a quarter of a century since the first atomic bomb was dropped over mankind.  I have tried to tell my children about my experience, but it doesn’t seem to have much impact on them.  I suppose they feel the way I felt about the stories I heard from my parents about the Great Kanto Earthquakes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe Great Kanto Earthquake was on September 1, and this day is still celebrated as “Disaster Prevention Day.”  August 6 is now A-Bomb Day.  I wonder if soon the memories of this day will be washed away just as the memories of September 1.  The difference surrounding these two events is the presence of the left-wing camps that are mobilizing the general public.  Even the leftist movement is not united.  We will probably never see the day when all citizens transcend their ideology and politics to unite and share humanity’s pain.  Whenever I see leaders from abroad visiting Japan, I am aware that they do not represent the true voices of the citizens of their countries.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe difference between the days of the Great Kanto Earthquake and today is the development of mass communication and media.  Unlike the event 48 years ago, we have many photographs and recorded stories of Hiroshima after the bomb.  I’m sure people abroad are reading these stories.  However, I am suspicious that they are being received simply as combat lessons.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was in the bombing, suffered from atomic bomb disease, and healed after a year.  At present, I am working, blessed with above-average health.  Out of the all five family members who were in Hiroshima on August 6, Mother was the only one who died.  Statistically, that would bring the death rate to 20%.  Under what circumstances does one survive?  This is what is being studied in the first world countries as their war strategies.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI have traveled abroad four times.  Each time I tried speaking with strangers from different localities about the atomic bomb.  In America, most often I got the response, “How unfortunate.”  “As long as the Soviets have atomic and hydrogen bombs, the U.S. need them too.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“The majority of Americans will survive (in a nuclear crisis),” were the words from the mouths of the general public of America.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was great concern in Canada:  “In the event of an attack the nuclear weapons will fly over Canadian territory.”  “Our skies are the war field for the American ABM (Anti Ballistic Missile).”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn Paris, they were more interested in speaking about the horrible experiences of the Nazi Gestapo and Auschwitz than talking about the atomic bomb.  A middle-aged German said to me,</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Italians are no good.  This time, let’s do it just with Japan and Germany,” as he held out his hand.   (I’m not sure what he meant by “do it,” I think he meant going to war.)  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEven in Switzerland, vowed to be a neutral country, I found something that symbolized the fear of nuclear warfare.  The government provided money to put 20 centimeter-thick metal doors from the basement of large apartment buildings.  It was to provide shelter from a nuclear blast.  “Switzerland will not go to war.  But the French border is 5 kilometers south of here.  The blast from a bomb that is dropped on France will not stop at the border”, they said.  At the military airport in the Swiss mountains, they kept English Hunter fighter planes in each concrete dugout along the runways.  It was laid out so that no matter where the blast came from, at least half of the planes would survive and be able to take off immediately.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nPerhaps due to experiencing the flames of war many times in the past, the European mentality towards war is quite different than that of the Japanese.  In the United States, the Anti-Vietnam War movement is spreading.  Is it because the American soldiers are bleeding in a faraway land that has almost nothing to do with America?  Although it is hard to feel close to a war that is happening in a remote country, I believe the reality of war hits home when a loved one is killed.  Humankind has developed science and technology and produced many weapons.  The Hague Treaty has outlawed the poisonous gas that tortured the English soldiers in World War I.  Out of the submarine battles, led by German U Boats, came the movement to restrict submarine warfare.  The movement to ban A-B-C (Atomic, Biological and Chemical) Weapons is gaining momentum.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBut we must remember that it is humans that control science and these weapons.  Without peace in our souls, we will never have a peaceful world.  It’s easy to blame the soldiers who dropped the bomb or those who made the orders.  You might criticize the people involved in the Sonmi Incident in South Vietnam.  But it is important to beg the question whether the parties concerned were of sound mind at the time.  I doubt they were.  People living in peaceful times have no right to judge soldiers on the battlefield.  Instead we must examine the source that drove the soldiers to the battlegrounds.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt seems that the Chinese are extremely worried about the return of militarist Japan.  This somewhat irrational fear must be due to the experiences of the Chinese invasion by the Japanese Army.  Our mission is to spread the message of the dreadful effects of the atomic bomb.  However, sharing our stories alone will not create peace.  Other countries may take our experiences and use them as battle lessons.  But if we want to create a world without war, true “world peace,” then we must call forward peace within each and every person’s heart.  Unless we recognize the human heart as the key to world peace, all other efforts will turn to dust.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNow as the fires of war are subsiding, I recognize the importance of joining our hands.  I pray that each and every person on earth is able to open their heart to peace.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n(October 4, 1970, on a holy night)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 79 years old now</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThese memoirs were first written in 1970,</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nand retouched in the 50th year of A-bombing,</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n10 years ago from now.

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">ATOMIC BOMB</p><p class=\"body_en\">August 5th, I took an over-crowded train from Mukainada Station and arrived at Hiroshima Station after 5:00 p.m.  I squeezed through the worst rush-hour foot traffic and hurried to the streetcar stop in front of the station.  There was already a long snaking line of homebound people waiting for the streetcars.  Pushed and shoved, I finally got onboard the streetcar to Koi.  The factory was going to be closed the next day due to electricity conservation.  Somewhat relaxed, I watched the city passing outside the window, the heat dwindling as it got darker.  The relaxation turned to sorrow as I noticed the mess of building demolition sites.  A dark city with no lights: what a contrast it was from the festive town that I used to know as a young man.  The dream-like images of days gone by crossed my mind like phantasmagoria.  There was a large electrical surge and the streetcar came to a stop, shaking its passengers once from side to side.  I snapped out of my daze and got off.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tI hurried to the store first, almost running.  Kenbo was playing there.  Matsuko still had work to do, so I went home without her.  I got busy preparing dinner.  Matsuko and Kenbo came home when I was done cooking the pumpkin and potatoes.  I didn’t have to work tomorrow.  The three of us had fun at the dinner table.  There was still some time before the air raid warning at night.  I played a while with Kenbo in the mosquito-net tent, still wearing my work clothes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI could barely stand how cute he was, as he tried to pronounce his words in baby talk.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tA little past 9pm Kenbo fell asleep with his mother’s breast in his mouth.  I passed some time looking through the art magazines I kept by my pillow.  I turned on the radio at 10 pm.  The warning was not in effect yet.  I checked the items in the emergency kit and went to bed at 10:30.  I woke up to the air raid warning a little before midnight.  I sneaked out of bed, put on my girdle in a hurry and jumped outside.  I walked around knocking one by one on my neighbors’ doors.  I stopped by the air defense office briefly and returned home.  Matsuko was in bed, listening quietly to the radio.  Kenbo was sleeping in peace.  I gave Matsuko a series of commands for emergencies, and doubled back to the office.  The entire group of air defense workers were there, gathered around the speaker.  The invading plane was taking its usual route over Bungo Waterway and Shikoku.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tAfter a little while, we received the information that the enemy plane was headed north over Itsukushima Island.  Off and on, we could faintly hear B-29s roaring through the clouds.  There must have been two or three of them.  The roar passed due north, over Hiroshima, and then shortly later headed south, once again flying over the town.  As the sound disappeared the air raid warning was lifted.  I must have been sleep deprived: I fell asleep for 5 to 10 minutes while I sat in the office.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tIt was around 2 a.m. when I got home.  Although it was in the middle of the summer, the air was cold in the night.  Matsuko and Kenbo were sleeping soundly, not even aware that B-29s had passed over them.  I took my girdle and other protective garments off and put my pajamas on for the first time that night and climbed into bed to get some real sleep, but I still kept the radio on.  I watched Kenbo sleeping peacefully and eventually drifted into deep sleep myself.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nRight around dawn, in my dream-like state I heard Mr. Wakabayashi stop by our house.  He brought the metal helmet that I had dropped in the office the night before.  I turned over and slept in, grateful that I had the day off.  I had breakfast a little past 7 a.m. and Matsuko left for the store, carrying Kenbo.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tI was planning to attend my colleague’s goodbye party at Banshoen Garden in the city at 11 a.m.  He was departing for the front.  I got some things ready for the party and poked my head in at the store.  I brought Kenbo back home so that I could play with him.  While I threw soiled laundry into the washtub and filled it with water, Kenbo went outside barefoot.  I figured he went to play at the Wakabayashi’s or at the store.  I remembered that I had left a dirty shirt hanging in the family room.  I wanted to soak it in water and went over to get it.  But then I thought about checking on Kenbo and I opened the window by the front door.  I didn’t see him in the alley in front of the house, so once again I told myself that he went either to the Wakabayashi’s or to the store, and I closed the smoked glass sliding door over the window.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tIt was at that moment that the glass that had been shimmering from the summer morning sunlight suddenly became much brighter.  I felt the heat against my skin.  A dreadful premonition sent me down on the floor by the front door.  What entered my ears was not something that can be called a “sound”, or shall I say, it was not something that could be “heard” by the auditory senses.  I felt an extreme pressure and everything started crumbling under the immense density.  I was surrounded in darkness.  Dust and whatever else clouded my vision and doors and shattered ceramics flew over my head.  It may have been a few seconds or a few minutes.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhile I laid for cover in the complete darkness I thought about how we must have been hit by a powerful bomb of gigantic proportions.  I had no way of telling where the epicenter was.  It felt close, but when I took into account the time lapse between the flash and the pressure from the blast, it seemed it could have been quite far.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tThe dust in the air settled down and the darkness started to clear.  The August sunlight started to cast a faint beam from the window without the glass door.  Immediately after I realized I was still alive, the thought of Kenbo entered my mind.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Oh, no!” I stood up, staggering.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy eyes hurt.  They were filled with gritty dust and dirt.  I put my hand on my forehead, which smeared blood all over it.  I pulled out the pieces of glass in my head and looked around the room.  All the furniture had been blown away.  Debris covered the tatami floors.  I was shirtless and wearing only a white pair of shorts.  The shorts were now died red with blood.  Where am I bleeding from?  I wondered.  I looked for my shoes but couldn’t find one of them.  I was just about to leave the house to look for Kenbo and Matsuko with just one shoe on, when Matsuko came home, carrying Kenbo.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tThey’re both alive.  I felt my spirit lift.  I wiped off Kenbo’s face, which was covered in black soot.  I only found a few scratches on his forehead.  The rest of his body was also uninjured.  I was so happy I wanted to cry.  Matsuko was also injury-free.  Was it a miracle or God’s grace?  We found a triangular cloth to wrap around the wounds on my head.  I was also bleeding form my left arm.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere must have been glass pieces stuck in the bottoms of my feet: The pinching pain was intolerable.  We gathered some necessities and left the home.  The alleys and the streets were littered with debris.  In the sky rose a huge pillar of smoke, shutting out the sunlight.  The edge of the smoke glowed suspiciously.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\tThe main street was filled with people wandering around.  I told Matsuko to take Kenbo and evacuate to the safe harbor along the Kanko road.  I checked on the members of the neighborhood association.  They were all fine, but were concerned about those who had left home earlier.  I assumed that they would be all right, too.  I couldn’t have been more wrong: most of them were never to return.  Fires had started in the Koi area.  We walked to the railroad bridge.  The whole city was engulfed in an enormous fire, and anything that would burn was ablaze.  People spoke amongst themselves:</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“What sort of bomb was it?”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n“Where do you think it was dropped?”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEveryone was pale from shock.  I had lost my sense of time. I was drenched in the rain following the atomic bomb.   While I dried my clothes in the heat of the ember in the scorched field, I noticed that the darkness of evening was approaching.  Creepy voices of the dying survivors could be heard everywhere…</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n(Wife Matsuko provided the essay written before his death)</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDeceased April 28th, 1968</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">PEACE THROUGH THE MILL</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDriving on an unknown road in France, Aya still felt the warm hand of Mr. T., the pilot of theB-29 “Eno la Gay” that dropped the A-bomb.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Only a few minutes ago she shook his hand. At the same time, Aya keenly thought about this man who had been living in anguish for 35 years. He might say to himself in his mind, “My God! What have we done? If I live a hundred years, I’ll never be able to get this thought out of my mind.”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  “Don’t you know that the city was completely destroyed?” the newscaster of T.V. France asked to Mr. T.<br />\n  “Yes, I know.”<br />\n  “Did you repent of it?” <br />\n  “No, I didn’t.”<br />\n  “Do you now repent even though Aya beside you, might have died?”<br />\n  “No, I don’t.”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  The shocking implication of the conversation could have knocked Aya down with mere brush of a feather.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  “Who’s he?” Aya whispered.<br />\n  “Is there a connection between this man and the bomb? How anguished he is!”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Aya, pondered this and felt sorry for the man and could not look at him directly in the face. Perhaps his features might suddenly comfort with pain and reveal his inner agony of soul.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  It was in February 1981 when Pope Jon-PaulⅡ came to Japan. Just 10 days before the Pope visited Japan, Aya suddenly received a telephone call from T.V. France through T.V. in Japan. They said that they were looking for someone who could go to France and appear on T.V. at the same time that the Pope was giving the Appeal for Peace in Hiroshima. The reason why she was called was that she filled the necessary requirements for a meeting.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Aya was a person who had been severely exposed to the awful experience of the bombing in Hiroshima as a child and as a young woman she had become a sister.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt first Aya refused the invitation. A few days later, she was called again, and told that they could not find any one else to represent the victims of the bomb. Aya could not continue to refuse. She accepted the invitation.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn France Aya had a surprise meeting with the pilot. She did not know who or what he was until the coverage was over. But she felt what he experienced in the exchange of words, which gripped her heart and held her fast. It seemed to her that his response to the questions could not have been otherwise. Aya thought, if she had been in his position, perhaps she would have answered in the same way.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Of course he could refuse to obey orders but could he virtually refuse in his situation? Wouldn’t the bomb have been dropped anyway if he had refused? Some one else surely would have replaced him, and dropped the bomb in his place.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  The damage from the bomb created unspeakable misery. Nobody could have imagined its violence; 200,000 people had been killed in an instant.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  That was not all.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Many people were transformed into monsters. Some of the survivors ground the bones of their dead neighbors into powder, and applied them to the burns of their own bodies with total indifference, in order to cure themselves; no one had medicine or medical treatment at that time. Every body desperately tried to do something for themselves no matter what the remedy! They heard that calcium might be effective for burns. They believed this and applied the crushed bones of their fellow human to their own burned bodies.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Is it possible for human beings to do such things under normal conditions? Is it possible for human beings to kill a single person in normal conditions? Is it possible for some one to bring such a bomb in normal conditions? Who is normal? It is the insanity of war?\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  The war transforms man into a crazy beast! The war is a devouring beast that feeds upon humanity itself that has become a beast in the utter destruction of its Nature. The Beast devours a beast. This is war!\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n What was Aya doing at that terrible summer day in August 1945?\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Instead of studying, all the students below grade two of the second middle school were working as laborers on the compulsory dismantling of houses, which was carried out to create firebreaks in the built up areas of the city. All the students above grade three had to work at the military supplies companies.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Then, Aya would have been on the compulsory dismantling of houses, but she was in bed. There was little or nothing the matter with her, but she was tired out and said to her mother, “I am feeling off today.” Hearing that, her mother was greatly anxious about her and forced her to be in bed.<br />\n  <br />\n  Aya wanted to go and do her duty; her mother did not want her to go. Aya decided to wait for her friend who usually called on her on the way, and they went together every day but on this day Aya was lying on her bed with her school uniform on.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  She wondered what had happened to her friend? She did not call for Aya that day. Had Aya missed an opportunity to do her duty through mere laziness? Was she wasting precious time lying on her bed thinking about this, that, and other things?\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Suddenly, there was a great flash and boom, as if some one had taken a photograph of the whole city with a gigantic camera. She could not fathom what was happening. In what seemed but a few moments, Aya found herself under the now destroyed house, as did countless other people, many of whom were killed by the awful fires raging everywhere.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Fortunately for Aya, she was dug out from beneath the rubble before the fire reached her destroyed house. However, she did not escape the deadly influence of radiation sickness caused by the bomb and she hovered between life and death for three months.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  She finally triumphed over the disease without any treatments, without even one drug.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  One day after the long hot summer had ended, Aya happened to meet the mother of her school friend, who used to call for her except for that final day in summer when she did not appear.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  “What was the matter with Kimi on that day?”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nKimi was her friend’s name.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  “Where is she now?” “Is she well?”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAya asked successive questions of Kimi’s mother. Her brow furrowed and her eyes dimmed with tears. She tried to answer as calm as she could.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  “On that day Kimi had a headache, and she wanted to stay at home. But saying that the soldiers in the front fought hard for us, so that she should not neglect her duty only because of a headache, I forced her to go. She dawdled and she was too late to call for you. I sent her on her way. That was the last I saw her. Kimi never came back to me. I could not find even a small piece of her bone.”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  “Heavens, what a ….!” In astonishment and disbelief Aya inwardly cried: “Oh daikirai! Kimi! Kimi! What a ….!” “I was not really ill, but I was encouraged to remain in bed by my mother and was saved. Kimi was really ill, but her mother forced her to go and she was killed.”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Who could praise or blame Kimi’s mother? The war made her crazy. That is the war. War! It is a terrible thief that steals sons from mothers, husbands from wives and deprives the children of parents. It steals the children from the parents and the earth is barren. “Rachel weeps for her children who are no more.” (Jeremiah 31:15)\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Mr. T. brought the bomb, but he was not so much a murderer as a victim along with the rest of the people of the city.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Some survivors felt that their city and been chosen for the singular purpose of suffering profoundly in order to bring peace to the world. They look upon their 200,000 dead as sacrificial victims for Peace and deeper insight into the meaning of suffering itself. Without suffering there is no seeing. Without sight there is no real joy.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Furthermore, Aya deeply meditates upon the two new bombs used in the World War Ⅱ, and believes that the responsibility belongs to all the people in this world: both those who brought them and those who directly suffered from the bombs.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  “I wonder if we, including myself, remember all the victims? If not, did they die to no purpose?”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  Aya ponders the warm hand of Mr. T.---\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\this heart <br />\n\t\this agony …<br />\n\t\t\tthen mingles it \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  with her heart and let it disappear as one into the boundless mystery of Love eternal.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n…73 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

Actually, it seems more appropriate to say that I was being given my life.  Since the time when I was 13 years old, many elements that were nothing short of miracles contributed to protect my life.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The Atomic Bomb Dome in the summer a year after the bombing… the Hiroshima Industrial Hall…  I immersed myself in drawing sketches of the people covered in wounds, standing on the scorched grounds, as if they had something to say.  Looking back, I believe that subconsciously I was preparing for my picture book, My Hiroshima.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Later I chose to study art and several times expressed my bomb experiences in oil paintings.  But the paintings could not compare to the reality of my experience.  As soon as the art show closed, the paintings were simply put into storage.  It didn’t fill the hollowness.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Fifty years old!  It was the turning point of my life.  It took me ten years to move to Australia.   My son, who had barely turned twenty, knocked on the door of a large publishing company and, as luck would have it, I was introduced to a famous editor-in-chief, Ms. A. I.  Life made an unexpected turn and I entered the world of picture-book publishing.  Ms. Y, my colleague and friend from my teaching days, used to push me to pass on my A-bomb experience for the next generation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n \nShe was excited to hear that I was creating a picture book and she sent me research materials and encouragements.  Then, unexpectedly she passed away before I could fulfill my promise to her.  I was filled with grief and regret.  Finally when I was ready to carry on with my work, Ms. A. I. was there to help me.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The labor was a painstaking process.  I pictured my own body as a model when I drew pictures of female students with skin dangling from their fingertips.  I imagined what I may have looked like had I been at the demolition site that day.  Most of the time it was impossible to hold back my tears.  Ms. Y’s death gave me strength.  In this manner, the picture book, My Hiroshima was born.  The next year I returned to Japan and put the book on Ms. Y’s Buddhist altar.  I apologized to her from the bottom of my heart that I was unable to complete this book while she was still alive.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Last year I was giving interviews for the NHK documentary program “Japanese in far Away Lands.”   I was shocked to hear the words of the retired editor-in-chief Ms. A. I.  She said that she had to fight for the creation of the picture book many times.  Many meetings were held, and eventually she had to convince the CEO of the publishing company in London in order to get it published.  I had no idea of this process behind the scenes.  One of the reasons they didn’t want to publish the book was because Japan used to be an enemy country.  There was also the sensitive issue of torture of the British and Australian prisoners of war by the Japanese.  Ms. A. I. insisted that we, as part of humanity, should teach our children the dreadful effects of the atomic bomb.  I was very blessed to have met wonderful people such as her.  I was able to bring out a picture book as a surviving witness of the event sixty years ago, thanks to being gifted with my life back then.\n </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOnce again, I give deep gratitude to the invisible but powerful force that kept me alive.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n… 73 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">Continue Talking Hiroshima</p><p class=\"image\"><img src=\"data/photo/setsuko_saaroo2.png\"></p><p class=\"body_en\">On August 6, 1945, I was a 13-year-old eighth grade student and a member of the Student Mobilization Program.  We students were starting our first day of work decoding messages at the military headquarters 1,8 kilometers from the hypocenter.  We were on the second floor of a wooden building.  At 8:15 a.m., just as Major Yanai was finishing his pep-talk urging us to do our best for the Emperor, I saw a bluish-white flash like a magnesium flare outside the window.  I remember the sensation of floating in the air.  As I regained consciousness in the total darkness and silence, I realized that I was pinned in the ruins of the collapsed building.  I knew I was faced with death.  Strangely, the feeling I had was not panic but serenity.  Gradually I began to hear my classmates’ faint cries for help.  “Mother, help me” ”God, help me!” Then, suddenly, a man’s voice said, “Don’t give up! I’m trying to free you! Keep moving! See the light coming through that opening.  Crawl toward it and try to get out!” By the time I came out, the ruins were on fire.  This meant that most of my classmates were burned alive.  A soldier ordered me and a few surviving girls immediately to escape to the nearby hills.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI turned around and saw the outside world.  Although it was morning, it looked like twilight probably because of the dust and dirt sucked up into the mushroom cloud.  People at a distance saw the mushroom cloud and heard a thunderous roar.  But I did not see the cloud because I was in the middle of it.  I did not hear the roar, just the deathly silence broken by the groans of the injured.  Streams of people were slowly shuffling from the city centre toward the nearby hills.  They were naked or tattered, burned, blackened, and swollen, and some had eyeballs fallen out of their sockets.  They were bleeding, ghostly figures like a slow-motion image from an old silent movie.  Some held their hands above the level of their hearts to lessen the throbbing pain of their burns.  Strips of skin and flesh hung like ribbons from their bones.  Often these ghostly figures would collapse in heaps never to rise again.  With my few surviving classmates, I joined the procession, carefully stepping over the dead and the dying.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt the foot of the hill was a military training ground about the size of two football fields.  Literally every bit of it was covered with the injured and dying, who were desperately begging for water, often in faint whispers.  But we had no containers to carry water, there were no medical supplies of any kind, and we did not see any doctor or nurse.  We went to a nearby stream to wash the blood and dirt from our bodies. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThen we tore off parts of our clothes, soaked them with water and hurried back to hold them to the mouths of the dying, who desperately sucked the moisture.  We kept busy at this task all day.  When darkness fell, we sat on the hillside, numbed by the massive scale of death and suffering we had witnessed, watching the entire city burn all night.  In the background were the low rhythmic whispers from the swollen lips of the ghostly figures, still begging for water.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the center of the city were about 8,000 students from grades 7 and 8 who had been mobilized to help clear fire lanes through the city.  Out in the open, close to the explosion, nearly all of them were killed instantly, vaporized without a trace and more died within days.  In this way, my age group in the city was almost wiped out.  My sister-in-law was a teacher supervising his students at this task.  Although my father and I searched for days, we never found her body.  She left two little children as orphans.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOne of my best friends, Miss Muramoto, was working on the fire lanes.  She lived long enough to tell us of the last moments of our classmates, who were drinking muddy water to quench their desperate thirst.  Although their eyes were swollen shut or eye-balls had come out, they recognized each other’s voice.  They gathered together and in whispering voices sang hymns such as “Nearer my God Thee.” One by one the students died.  The supervising math teacher, Ms. Mutsuko Yonehara, suggested that she might help those who could walk to reach the Red Cross Hospital.  Miss Muramoto put her hand on the teacher’s shoulder and felt the skin and flesh come loose.  She could see the teacher’s white shoulder bone.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAll the hospitals were destroyed or severely damaged, and the majority of health care professionals were killed or seriously injured.  Injured people who managed to reach a damaged hospital lay on the floor in the scorching heat and in their filth or on the ground outside with hardly any medical attention.  As a result maggots covered their bodies.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThose who could be moved and who had friends and relatives to help were taken to other towns and villages for care and cremation.  For example, when my uncle finally located his badly injured daughter, fearing another atomic bomb he loaded her on a cart and walked all night pulling her to safety in a mountain village.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFortunately my father was out of town that morning and my mother dug herself out of the ruins before they caught fire.  However, my sister and her four-year old son, Eiji were crossing a bridge at the moment of the explosion and both were terribly burned, blackened and swollen beyond recognition.  My parents could later recognize my sister only by her voice and by a unique hairpin she wore.  They lingered for several days without medical care of any kind, until death at last released them from their agony.  Soldiers threw In their bodies in a ditch, poured on gasoline and threw a lighted match.  They turned the bodies with bamboo poles, saying, “The stomach is not burned yet”, “The head is only half burned.” These I was, a 13-year old girl, standing with my parents, witnessing this most grotesque violation of human dignity with no tears or other appropriate emotional response.  A friend of mine later told me of returning to where her home had stood and finding the skeletons of her entire family and not being able to shed any tears.  The memories of this kind of behavior troubled me for many years until I learned from the research of U.S. psychiatrist Professor Lifton of Yale University who said that in such a sudden massive immersion in overwhelming and grotesque suffering and death, the emotional response shut down as a defense mechanism.  Lifton coined the terms “psychic closing off “ and “psychic numbing.” I am personally grateful to Lifton for his insight, which has assisted my own psychological healing.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBesides the terrific blast and the heat which was one million degrees Centigrade at the point or explosion, the unique and mysterious effect of the atomic bomb was radiation that afflicted many people.  For example, my favorite uncle and aunt, who were in the suburbs, had no external injuries.  But a couple of weeks later they began feeling sick and developed purple spots on their bodies.  We did not know then that the sickness was due to radiation.  According to my mother who cared for them until their deaths, their internal organs seemed to be rotting and dissolving and coming out in a thick black liquid.  Later we were told that if purple spots appeared on our bodies, this was a sure sign that we would soon die.  Every morning, our routine was anxiously to examine our bodies for the dreaded purple spots.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThus my beloved city of 360,000, close to ninety percent of whom were women, children and the elderly, suddenly and totally became a scene of devastation, heaps of ashes and rubble, skeletons and blackened corpses.  By the end of 1945 approximately 140,000 had perished.  However the effects of radiation continue down through the decades, even to the present.  The tragic legacy of Hiroshima has been extended not only to the people of Nagasaki three days later, but to American and Australian soldiers, Pacific islanders, North American aboriginal people, down winders and Russians, wherever uranium mining and weapons testing, and actual use have taken place.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter we could adjust to the traumatic defeat and surrender, we began to feel a great sense of relief and liberation from the oppression of our ultra-nationalistic and militaristic society.  We felt hopeful for the future of democracy promised by the U.S. Occupation, which also introduced needed reform in education, agriculture, women’s political and social rights, labor unions, corporate structures, etc.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn contrast, however the U.S. Occupation imposed psycho-social-political oppression on Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors.  For example, within days of Japan’s formal surrender they introduced a Press Code in Japan.  This meant a rigid censorship of anything critical of the U.S. and particularly anything to do with human suffering caused by the atomic bombs.  The Occupation authorities confiscated diaries, poems, photographs, movie film, microscopes, slides, and doctor’s records on the treatment of radiation, some 32,000 items in all.  Autopsies had to be done in secret and the results passed from hand to hand under threat of prosecution.  Because of this politically oppressive and hostile milieu, survivors were deprived of the normal process of grieving following their massive trauma and had to suffer in silence and isolation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAn additional injury to the psyche of the survivors was caused by the American establishment of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Its mandate was solely to study the effects of radiation upon human beings but not to offer treatment, even though thousands were suffering from inadequate medical care.  The ABCC did not even share its research findings with Japanese doctors, who were trying to deal with the new and unknown medical problem of radiation without adequate knowledge.  The survivors’ sense of outrage at being treated as guinea pigs in the original atomic bombings and now by the ABCC had to be repressed because of Occupation policies.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWith the end of the Occupation and the return of full sovereignty to Japan in 1952, a flood of political, scientific, medical and historical information  became available enabling researchers, scholars, and journalists for the first time to see the experience of the survivors in historical perspective and global context.  Gradually they became aware that the main motive for the atomic bombings was political to impress the Soviet Union and to force Japan to surrender before the Soviet Union could enter the war against Japan and claim the territorial rewards promised by the U.S. and Britain at the Yalta Conference.  They did not see the atomic bomb was necessary to bring about a Japanese surrender.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSome survivors became able to conceptualize and articulate the meaning of nuclear weapons as a threat to planetary survival.  This ability enabled them to transcend their own personal tragedies and empowered them to become committed to the mission of warning the world of the dangers of the nuclear age.  At about the same time information became available about Japan’s crimes and atrocities in the war so that we no longer saw ourselves solely as victims but also as victimizers of our fellow Asians.  We began to pressure the Japanese government to acknowledge Japan’s past crimes and atrocities during the war.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs a result of my reading and study I soon learned that the indiscriminate mass murder of civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was contrary to international law but was carefully planned and executed at the highest levels of the American government.  The Interim Committee advised the President to use two bombs as soon as possible, without prior warning, and the targets to be industrial or military centers surrounded by workers’ houses.  Richard Falk, professor of international law at Princeton University, put it this way:</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n  \tThe bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were viewed as contributions to the ending of a [popular and just] war.  Therefore they have never been appraised in the necessary way as atrocities.  They have never been understood as they certainly would have been understood had Hiroshima and Nagasaki been located in [an Allied country].  Somehow we have got to create that awareness, so that Hiroshima is understood to have been on the same level of depravity, and in many ways far more dangerous to us as a species and as a civilization than was even Auschwitz.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThrough my own experience of that fateful day, its immediate aftermath, the years of Occupation, the post occupation period and through my own studies I became overwhelmed by the sense of secrecy, enforced silence, manipulation, deceit, misinformation and half-truths which I came to believe have been characteristics of the nuclear age from the beginning.  I believe the highly centralized decision making of nuclearism?the dependence on nuclear weapons for security?is a serious erosion of the foundation of democracy.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe survivors regard nuclear weapons as the ultimate evil which cannot coexist with humanity, because they have the potential to annihilate our species and civilization.  Modern nuclear weapons are a thousand times more powerful than the primitive Hiroshima bomb.  Therefore we demand nothing less than the total abolition of nuclear weapons.  Anything less than abolition is compromise with evil.  Some may say this is naive and utopian.  But today even generals and admirals with detailed technical knowledge and experience of these weapon systems are also advocating the total abolition of nuclear weapons.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLet us reflect on the great social revolutions of the past, such as the abolition of slavery, the end of colonialism, the end of apartheid, women’s rights and civil rights for all in the United States.  These movements began in the minds of a few, were scoffed at, and eventually triumphed.  Like these movements the abolition of nuclear weapons is basically a moral issue to ensure the future for our children and all future generations.  As a high school student I happened to read a report of the World Council of Churches.  I felt electrified to read their definition of peace.  “Peace is the process of struggle to provide justice for all.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the Peace Park in Hiroshima is a cenotaph with the inscription, “Rest in peace; the mistake will NOT be repeated.” What mistake and whose mistake were purposely left ambiguous.  Some wanted to point an accusing finger at America but I was pleased that the citizens’ committee put the issue on a higher moral and philosophical plane, signifying the universal need for nothing less than a cultural transformation away from our obsession with violence and war.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the occasion of his visit to Hiroshima, Pope John Paul Ⅱstated that to remember the past is to dedicate oneself to the future.  To remember Hiroshima is to dedicate oneself to peace.”  Please join in the prayer and vow of the survivors of Hiroshima.  “Rest in peace; the mistake will NOT be repeated.”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n…73 years old</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Hiroshima Jogakuin Association</p></div></div>",

It was at the end of my night shift as a nurse trainee at the pediatric ward at Tenshin Hospital. The enemy planes had been flying over the city of Hiroshima, but they had never dropped bombs. In those days, we had been used to the air raid alert sirens and did not react to them.<p class=\"body\">On the morning of August 6th, I woke up to find myself blown 5 meters away from the office. The last thing I remembered was that I finished my errands in the office where we stamped the attendance book and was leaving the room. It was total darkness. I was terrified not knowing what had happened. I was lying face down in front of the washroom. As light came back slowly, I could see people with frizzed up hairs and bloody faces. There is nothing to compare to that sight. I thought to myself that was how the hell must look like. I assumed that the hospital must have taken a direct hit. I examined myself and found my white gown darkened with blood running from my neck. But I was concerned more about following attacks than the pain.</p><p class=\"body\">The hospital was in commotion with people seeking help. There were an army cadet school and army facilities nearby. Some soldiers had upper half of the hair intact and lower half seared and with ashen faces like primitive men, others had uniforms all burned away except their belts. Many had charred skins hanging from their bodies or covered with wounds. Some had lost their minds calling for their mothers or crying for water. No matter how much said and written it was a sight impossible to be described.</p><p class=\"body\">It was difficult to walk without shoes because shattered glass pieces were everywhere, but somehow I went up to the second floor to get first aid kits from the nurse office. On the way, I saw my colleague, Ms. Kinuko Di on the stairs. Her mouth was torn up to her ear and opened wide, and blood was running from the cut. She was groaning, but there was nothing I could do to help her. Feeling guilty, I continued to head to the office, but the room was filled with fallen objects and I could not enter. (Ms. Kinuko Doi, now Kinuko Laskey is the anti-nuclear activist in Vancouver, Canada.)</p><p class=\"body\">I feared the building would become a target of another raid and wanted to go back to my parents. I tried to get out to the street but someone said to me, “You will die if you don’t stop the bleeding right away.” Then I realized that blood was gushing out from my left hand. The vein had been severed by a glass shard. I cut the string of my monpe pants and tried to stop the bleeding with it, but it was no use. I rushed to the pediatric ward. I have no memory after that. When I became conscious again by someone’s voice saying “A fire broke out!” Dr. Sasada was selflessly trying to stop the bleeding. His arm was burned by the heat ray of the atomic bomb, and his charred skin was hanging.</p><p class=\"body\">Falling in and out of conscious, I made it to the courtyard of Tenshin Hospital being pulled by the hand by a senior nurse. We ran though the flames that were changing directions by the wind, splashing water from the storage tank over ourselves. I still remember how the heat from the burning buildings hurt my body through my nurse’s gown that was shredded by glass shards. From the hospital windows, flames were licking the buildings like the devil’s tongue. I saw a person inside the building gone mad throw himself to death.</p><p class=\"body\">Dragged by a senior nurse, I reached the open space in front of the communication center. There were 6 or 7 injured people gathered. Dr. Hachitani, the head Physician and Ms. Suzuko Numata were among them. Ms. Suzuko’s broken bones were sticking out from her leg. (Ms. Suzuko Numata is now with a prosthetic leg and active as a peace activist. I see her on TV and newspapers.)</p><p class=\"body\">The late afternoon, I left the burning Hakushima-cho heading to Misasa with a person from the center and a colleague trying to get home somehow. On the way, there were a lot of corpses. Dying people were asking for water, but we could do nothing for them but telling them to hang in there.</p><p class=\"body\">A third of the way on Misasa Bridge, there was a person on a bicycle, holding the handles tightly and leaning on the railing. He was dead with his face burned black, his white teeth exposed, and his eyes wide open without eyelids. He must have died instantly by the direct head ray. I felt as if my body and mind were shrinking up with terror. A horse was pulling a burning carriage. The horse had also hanging charred skins and was walking along people without her owner. Many dead bodies were floating in Otagawa River, some facing up, other facing down. Their faces were swelling and unrecognizable.</p><p class=\"body\">The roof of my house had fallen down and the inside was filled with debris. It was not living condition. I rested leaning on the piled futons in the open area of the workshop. I could not lie down because I had 15 cuts that looked like open mouths of infants on my back and lower body. I still have glass pieces under my skin. Some are as big as 4 centimeter. Because medication to treat wounds weren’t available, and the wounds were left to infection, my scars are large and visible.</p><p class=\"body\">Two months later, I went back to work. At the burned ruins of the communication center and the hospital, tatamis and reed mats were placed on the concrete floor. On them, many people moaning with pain and high fever were laid. My duty was to remove maggots from their infected wounds.</p><p class=\"body\">Even though they had no visible injury, people who had inhaled the toxic gas lost hair and developed red sores inside the mouth, bleeding from the gum, bloody stool, vomiting of blood, and high fevers over 40 degree. The doctors didn’t know the cause and thought it was a dysentery outbreak. At one point, they isolated those patients.</p><p class=\"body\">Some of them lost their minds from high fever and died moaning, “Mother, mother.”  People who started vomiting eventually died within one week. I was worried that I would be next who would go through the course of symptoms: losing hairs, fever, spots, vomiting, diarrhea, so on. Every day I pulled my hair and checked my body for spots. I lived in such fear that I didn’t feel like alive.</p><p class=\"body\">Since many of the dead were not identifiable, the bodies were gathered in one place and burned. I remember dead bodies and bones of many horses were also piled up at the burned ruins of the barracks.</p><p class=\"body\">The terrifying memories of the event where so many lives were taken away at once have been fading away as the years pass. But no matter where we walk in the city of Hiroshima, under our feet there are spirits of the people who died in agony. I hope the fact that today’s peace exists over their sacrifices will not be forgotten. I hope my dear children and grandchildren will not have to go through what we went through, and I hope there will be always peace.</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">Produced by TAZI Yayoi</p></div></div>",
