It was an unforgettable day for me. Most people do not have memories of when they are 4 years old, but I clearly remember  that day.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was on the second floor and my house collapsed at the time when I noticed a flash outside, and I was trapped  under the block wall not knowing what had happened. I was totally confused . I don’t know how much time passed , but a soldier who worked for my father came to rescue me. My father was an adjutant at No 16710 Marine  Radio regiment and had 7,000 men under him. I could hear the soldier saying something to me, but could not understand. I was hearing impaired because of the shock. When I finally struggled to crawl out of the block wall, the soldier broke into tears in relief. We started to walk towards my father’s regiment crying. On the way, the land was devastated and the river was colored  red with blood. A dying person grabbed my skirt and asked me for water. So I cried again. I also saw many people died while drinking water from  the river. </p><p class=\"body_en\"> When the atomic bomb was dropped, my 13 year old  cousin was on a train, on her way to school. I went to look for her with my aunt. She  found a body in the charred train with her daughter’s name tag, holding on to a strap. When I called my cousin’s name and grabbed her, she collapsed and crumbled to the ground.</p><p class=\"body_en\"> Although I was with a soldier from my father’s regiment, I was not able to meet with  my father. All he did was to put  me in a safe bomb shelter. I was not able to meet my father for a month. My father first had to take care of the 7,000 men working for him, before taking care of me . </p><p class=\"body_en\"> Looking back, it would have been better if I died that day, since my life after was terrible . </p><p class=\"body_en\"> Since  the atomic bomb was created to kill people, it would have been better if everyone who experienced the bomb died without any survivors.  It would have been much better than living in a world of suffering. I already had enough of it.</p><p class=\"body_en\"> When I returned to the epicenter of the blast 2 or 3 days later, I found a mountain of dead bodies. My father’s regiment pulled out the dead bodies from  the river and stacked them . In order to receive the atomic bomb survivor’s certificate, I had to prove my home address. But I could not prove my address because my certificate of residence has been lost . I had to find a witness to prove that I  lived in the hypocenter area. It is true that my house in Deshio town was only 2.5 kilometer away from where the atomic bomb dropped. I was able to receive the survivor’s certificate by applying the military address, but my father could not receive it. How could this happen? My father died of leukemia 10 years after the atomic bomb. </p><p class=\"body_en\"></p><p class=\"body_en\"> I will never forgive a war breaking out. However, war is being repeated  in Iraq and around the world. Can’t people understand how sad war is  unless they have a painful experience? Can’t the younger generation understand the misery of  war even if they don’t have the  experience? I don’t want the world to repeat the mistake of going to war ever again. </p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">The Great Tokyo Air Raid and Hiroshima</p>\n<p class=\"image\"><img src=\"data/photo/ishii_junsuke2.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"body_en\"> I had experienced the Great Tokyo Air Raid on March 10, 1945, and then was called for military service in the Hiroshima No. 16710 Marine Radio base supply regiment the following April, and I experienced the Hiroshima Atomic Bomb on August 6th. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n《B-29 low-level bombing made me realize our defeat in war》The Japanese Army suffered a crushing defeat in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. US troops established a bombing base in the Mariana Islands of Saipan, Guam and Tinian to prepare for bombing the Japanese-mainland. Our six-member family lived in Kitazawa, Setagaya Ward in Tokyo at the time. When we noticed a wisp of jet contrail in the clear blue sky, a silver object shined at the tip and approached towards us rapidly for bombing. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe Great Tokyo Air Raid, on March 10, 1945, made me keenly realize the defeat in war.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn March 9, a few minutes after the air alert, several B29 bombers were flying low in the air, about 1,500 – 2,000 meters, to attack the Japanese mainland. Surprisingly, the Japanese battle planes were caught off guard by the B-29, and not even a single plane came into the air for interception. Anti-aircraft guns were fired from the ground in vain. I could see B29 flying at ease like monstrous birds. It was said that more than a hundred bombers were dispatched in one night. It was exactly a terrible indiscriminate bombing.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe downtown area of Tokyo （Honsho, Fukagawa, and Asakusa）burst into flames by the firebombs dropped, and we could see the night sky turning into red even from the far mountainsides.</p><p class=\"body_en\">At midnight on March 9,1945, the Great Tokyo Air Raid killed 90,000 people in the fire and as many as one million died. It is said to be the biggest aerial attack Japan experienced, except the Atomic Bomb Attacks in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Ironically, the following day, March 10, was the Japanese Army Anniversary of Russo-Japanese War Victory. I thought it would be an unforgettable day for Tokyo citizens who experienced the tragedy for themselves.</p><p class=\"body_en\">《My house in Akasaka was damaged》Due to my father’s job, we had to leave our house in Kitazawa　in Setagaya Ward and move to Akasaka in Central Tokyo in mid-March, even though we knew that Akasaka had more risk of attack. We rented a two-wheeled cart and reluctantly made many roundtrips between Kitazawa and Akasaka to move our belongings. The heavy slopes of Miyamasuzaka in Shibuya made us exhausted. That new house in Akasaka was destroyed by the air raid on May 25. At that time, I was in Hiroshima serving for the Hiroshima Akatsuki Troops. My younger brother was in Edajima in Hiroshima serving for the Marine, and the youngest brother and my eldest sister were in Shinshu for school evacuation. My parents lived in Tokyo evacuated to the Akasaka Palace after losing our house. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n《Go campaigning to Hiroshima Akatsuki Troops！》In April, 1945, I took a night train from Shinagawa Station to Hiroshima to serve for the #16710 Akatsuki Troops. By chance, my classmate Takahashi joined the troop on the same day. Still now, we both are alive and well, and enjoy our friendship. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n《Atomic Bomb dropped on Hiroshima》On that day, August 6, I was at the quad in the military base making an application for a transfer after four months of training. At the same time I heard a faint blast, I was blown out into the air by a sudden white flash light. Since I could not see an inch ahead, I dove to the ground instinctively. I looked up fearfully after a while, but quickly put my head down again since it was dark around, even though it was daytime. I almost lost consciousness while breathing only shallow breaths, but I managed to regain visibility.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe impact of the damage was beyond imagination. The barrack was half collapsed barely keeping its shape, and the outer wall had totally crumbled. Fortunately, I was wearing my military uniform, therefore only the left side of my face and my left hand, which were exposed to the sun were hurt. Without this uniform, I could have been injured much worse. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was too badly injured to participate in the rescue operation. I was moved to the elementary school located on the low hill in the Hiroshima suburbs in order to get medical treatment. Most of the injured people accommodated there were military officers. It was a horrible sight filled with bad smell and groaning voices. Some people were seriously burned from their faces to their entire bodies, and were lying on the beds incapable of moving. A lot of people died since the only treatment available was to put a red Mercurochrome to the wound. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n《Discharge from Hiroshima troop》After being discharged in October, I went back to a rented house in Mita(Meguro Ward) which had luckily survived the fires. Although the area around Meguro station was burned down by war, I was able to find my family with support from neighbors. I was the last one in my family to return home. Our family all rejoiced that all six of our family members survived. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n《After the war》Japanese citizens were finally freed from the military administration, and gained zest for living and creating our own future of our free will. The food situation was so severe that we had to cultivate the burnt ruins to grow our own food with hardly any days off. After graduating from school in 1945, thanks to my senior Mr. Tomoda, I got a job at a company called Anritsu Corporation. In 1951, when the Japanese economy prospered by special procurement demand from Korea, I made a job change to Shiba Electric. Then the rapid economic growth, what is called the “Miracle of the 20th Century” started to lose its momentum after the Tokyo Olympic games. The economy was damaged by the oil shock in 1973. Our company merged with Hitachi in 1975, and I reached mandatory retirement age in 1985. I appreciate support from my family, friends and colleagues which enabled me to work for 40 years to retirement age. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n《My second life》As the representative of the Hachioji Atomic Bomb Survivors Association, I had an opportunity to attend the Peace Memorial Service for Atomic-Bomb Victims held in 1988, with Mr. Furukawa, the representative of Tokyo bereaved family. We prayed sincerely and paid a floral tribute for the victims and vowed for peace. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n60 years have passed since the end of the war, and each generation keeps changing. We shall never forget that the biggest reason why Japanese have enjoyed the prosperity after the war is that it is always peaceful. We, Japanese, have the mission to abandon nuclear weapons and chemical weapons, as we are aware of the misery and cruelty of war. Furthermore we have to succeed lasting peace and appreciation for preciousness of life to the next generation.</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

It is now part of the Peace Memorial Park. Our family had a general merchandise wholesale store there. Since business was considered “peace industry”, my father was called up for military service, and our family had to close the wholesale store and move to Kabe town, which is about 15 kilometers north of Hiroshima.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the morning of August 6th, my grandmother was reading a book to me, lying on the porch. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt 8:15 a.m., surprised at the flash and blast, we flew out to the yard and saw a parachute descending. My grandmother told me later that I screamed “Look. The moon!” pointing at the parachute though I don’t quite remember. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat day, a parachute landed in Oke Area, on the mountainside of Kabe, and a few men rushed over to it holding bamboo spears. My mother was 26 years old, and I was only three at that time.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA few days later, my mother and I went to Motoyanagi Town, where we used to live, and several banks in downtown Hiroshima to check if there were any household goods or savings left though I have no recollection. Due to this experience, my mother, my younger sister and I are the ones in our family who have the A-bomb survivor’s certificates.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I was a child, my mother used to talk to me about the wreckage of the city and how she was engaged with the rescue activities. Her stories were too shocking for me as a child. In particular, a story about aiding   A-bomb survivors with burns that had larva growing in their wounds, screaming, “It hurts, It hurts,” was too shocking. According to my mother, there were no medical supplies and all they could do was to pick out larva one by one with  chopsticks. Many people died suffering from pain and their bodies were piled up beside the river and got burnt. She told me that some of them piled up were still alive, and she heard their death throes while they were being burnt alive.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn midnight of August 6th, my mother’s younger sister, who was 20 years old at the time, barely made her way home with blood all over her body. Later, she got married and had a child, and died of cancer when she was in her mid-fifties.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI often recall that when I was a high school student, I participated in the Peace Memorial Service every year with my classmates and friends and sang “Hiroshima Peace Song”. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMany people say that there was discrimination against A-bomb survivors in terms of marriage and getting a job, but I have never experienced such discrimination. I had a classmate who had keloids on his body, but nobody discriminated against him. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNow, as an A-bomb survivor, I suggest we should create a world without nuclear weapons, make Japan remorse the wrong understanding of war responsibility, and work on the early realization of war compensation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nPlease imagine what really happened to the A-bomb survivors through the devastating nuclear cloud. About the ball of flame that was expressed as “brighter than a thousand sun”. About the high pressure shock wave, profuse gamma beam, neutron radiation, and the fire blast of 3,000 to 4,000 degrees Celsius. The ongoing mental and physical pain, anxiety, anguish, and hardship of life of survivors. Who in the world could have gone through such a tragic experience but the A-bomb victims? However, the path they have chosen was not retaliation. “We shall never repeat the same mistake again.” “Humanity cannot coexist with nuclear weapons.” The path they have chosen is to abolish nuclear weapons. What an exalted spirit! </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nTo my regret, there are still many wars going on around the world. Can war bring us peace? We have learned from the World War 2 that we need to deny any violence in order to create world peace. That is why the United Nations was established. The Japanese Constitution was established on the extension line of the UN’s principle, and the famous Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution was written. If you read the minutes of the diet back then, you will find Prime Minister Yoshida and other ministers declared the Japanese Constitution be a “Constitution that Japan can be proud of”, and that “Japan shall be the country to take the initiative in aspiring peace.” </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI strongly believe that if the whole human family can share the heart of the A-bomb survivors and victims, the door to peace and nuclear weapon abolishment will open.\n</p></div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

Just when I sat down at my desk and opened my notebook, I saw a white light coming in from the window. Then, in the blink of an eye, the building collapsed. The blast was so strong I thought I had been thrown into a bottomless abyss. After a while, not knowing if I was alive or dead, I opened my eyes slowly. I could not see anything but yellow smoke. When I heard somebody screaming the teacher’s name, I finally concluded that I was alive. By then I was able to see my surroundings faintly. I crawled out of the rubble, relying on dim light filtering in from outside.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I got out, I was surprised that our building was not the only one wrecked. All the other buildings and dormitories were wrecked as well. Many students were crawling out of the wrecked buildings one after another, but none of them was uninjured. Their clothes were torn. Their hair was bushy with dust, and some of them were bleeding from head wounds. It was hard to imagine that the same place had been filled with fun just few minutes earlier……</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLater, teacher advised a few of my classmates and me to evacuate to the airport in Yoshijima, along with some of the badly injured victims. They were so injured it was hard for us to recognize them as human beings. Since I, too, was badly injured, I collapsed on the floor and stayed there for few days.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI had glass fragments in my back, the back of my head, and right arm. I also had a burn on the right side of my face, my right arm, right leg, back and hip. The right side of my body was injured because the window had been on my right. In addition, I was not able to lay on my back because I had so many bruises from the collapsing rubble.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDue to the heat and lack of hygiene, my burned skin blistered that day. By the next morning, the blisters were full of yellow pus. Military medics peeled the skin with a pair of tweezers and washed the pus away with salt water, then put oil on the burn. Since I had number of blisters on my body, I fell into a stupor due to the intense pain of the salt water. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThough it was a painful treatment, most of my scars disappeared over the years, except for the keloid scar on my right arm. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI am profoundly grateful to those military medics who gave us medical treatment back then. I am sure they had a tough time taking care of us. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLater I heard that our school building had burned down that afternoon. Three students were found dead under a big beam. One of them was a close friend. I had known her for years, even before we entered high school. I have never really recovered from the emotional pain of losing her that day.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOf the 81 students in my grade, seven died that day. Three in the classroom, two in the dormitory, one in the yard and one at the hospital.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSome who were thought to be only lightly injured and who worked with the teachers under the burning sun to rescue the injured from the wrecked school building were later found to be quite seriously injured. In addition, since some of our classmates were from towns far away, it took them a long time to get home, riding in trains with ripped, bloodstained clothes, giving off the terrible smell of burns and injuries. I can hardly imagine their mental and physical pain as they struggled to get home under those conditions. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNot knowing about those classmates then, I had no time to worry about others. I was worrying about myself and was waiting for my family to pick me up. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA few days after the bombing, my father came to get me and we returned home together. Then, I was told that my mother had been killed by the atomic bomb. Losing my mother at the age of seventeen is how I developed my hatred and fear of war.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs a war storyteller, I have visited schools several times a year to tell my story to children. I always tell not only my own story, but also the stories of the burned children who were outside that day working for their country. I want the children I meet to understand how cruel the atomic bomb was. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe children who were burned to death that day were only twelve or thirteen years old. Many of the children who gather to hear my story are about the same age. The faces of the children listening to my story overlap with the faces of the children who were burnt to death by the atomic bomb. The deep sorrow toward the children who burned to death overlap with my prayers for happy lives for the children in the present. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn February 28, 1999, the story about the children who burned to death was covered by our local newspaper (Chugoku Shinbun). The title of the article was “Futures destroyed”. The article informed us that a total of 1,207 students and 10 school staff from the Hiroshima 2nd Junior High School were working near the hypocenter and were killed by the atomic bomb. The damage to the bodies was so severe that only one out of four could be identified. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSince I experienced the pain of burns caused by the atomic bomb, my heart breaks whenever I think about the children who were burned to death by the 3,000 to 4,000 degree heat. This pain is beyond imagination but has left a long-lasting scar on my heart.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt is said that around seven thousand two hundred students died of in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. So many young lives were lost, their futures filled with so many possibilities were taken away.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs a storyteller of the atomic bomb, I insist on “the importance of peace”, “the preciousness of life” and most importantly, “abolition of nuclear weapons”. Nuclear weapons are so brutal. They are made for massacre. Atomic bomb victims know how cruel nuclear weapons are. It is our earnest wish to abolish nuclear weapons from the Earth. All atomic bomb victims have the same wish. I am convinced that my mission is to convey this wish to the next generation.</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

I was 12 years old (6th grader in elementary school). Although most of my classmates were evacuated from the city, I was left in Hiroshima since I had to see a doctor regularly for my leg injury. I recall that the number of peers that were left in Hiroshima were small just enough to make one classroom. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe hospital I went to was called the Shima-Hospital, and it was very near the epicenter. I usually don’t go to the hospital so early, but that day, I was at the Ibi-station on my way to Miyajima with my mother and younger sister. We experienced the atomic bomb there. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLuckily, all three of us were able to escape uninjured, and headed to the evacuation shelter in Itsukaichi. On the way, we came across many victims escaping from the city. They were heavily injured that we could not bear to see them directly. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMany injured people have been carried to Miyajima from Hiroshima, and were bed fully in the coastline of the Toyokuni Shrine. There are no words to express how horrible that sight was.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nTwo or three days later, my mother retuned to the city to search for her relatives, but she had finally never spoke about how it went, until she died forty-four years after the bomb at the age of ninety three. Some of her relatives were killed by the bomb.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy mother didn’t want to talk about her experience of the atomic bomb. I understand how she feels. In fact, I feel the same way. I also don’t want to talk about the atomic bomb experience. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt that time, my father was in China to study calligraphy. Later, I heard that he joined the army after the war broke and moved from place to place. After the war, he returned to Japan, but my mother did not share her atomic bomb experience with him.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI think it is a common feeling for the A-bomb victims that they do not want to recall their bad memories of war. That is how cruel the atomic bomb is. The suffering and sorrow still exists, and will not be healed forever. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBut ironically, A-bomb victims are the only people that can hand on the horrible experience to the next generation.</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

August 6th</p>\n<p class=\"image\"><img src=\"data/photo/tsutada2.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">\nSince I was a student of the public industrial evening school, I had a daytime job at the military supply base located in Kaita city. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the morning of August 6th 1945, I experienced the atomic bomb at the military supply base which I was working for. 　I arrived to the supply base earlier than usual, from my boarding house which was located about 1.5 kilometers away from the epicenter. Few seconds after the bomb dropped, a furious blast wave from the ocean hit us and some of the storages in the base was blown off.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLooking at the mushroom-shaped cloud above Hiroshima city, we thought that the gas tank in Minami-city was bombed. I and few others jumped on the military truck and headed to the city. When we passed by Kouyo area, we saw many people heading towards us.　</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was an extraordinary spectacle. Some had a blister all around their face, some had blood all over, some had their pants burned down and walking with their legs exposed. Some were swinging their hair and walking like noctambulists, some were walking with their melted skin hanging down like a ghost. We could not move forward from Kaniya town since there were many collapsed buildings or tangled electric cables blocking our way. We decided to help the victims that were lying down around, and some calling help from collapsed buildings. We dragged them up to our truck and took them to the nearby elementary school.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe elementary school was already filled with people whom evacuated from the attack. For the people that had burn injuries, cooking oil was applied to the wound by an ink brush. We also put oil to some rag and cured the burned victims. The room was filled with abnormal odor.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen we returned to Kaniya town area, there were many victims asking us for help. We helped them again and took them to the evacuation school. Then we left our truck and headed to our boarding house to see whether it was safe.\nRunning through the collapsed buildings, we finally reached the military square and found many victims lying down under the sun because of heavy burn injuries. The city was covered with flames and smokes. I had finally noticed that some kind of outrageous bomb must have dropped. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe Shrine near the west military parade ground was filled with injured soldiers. Most of the soldiers had swollen faces and everted lips. Most of their field caps were blown off by the bomb, as well as their shirts and pants.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe injured soldiers swarmed to the red cross marked medicine box which the military medic had. We took out so called “red iodine” and applied them to the wounds of the injured soldiers. We also put some red iodines to ourselves in order to pretend like we were also injured. We laid down between the injured soldiers and waited for the city to totally burn to the ground. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere were so many injured people laying down everywhere that we could not do anything. We felt the searing wind along with the terrible odor. As time passed, mushroom shaped cloud gradually deformed and blown to the west side of the city.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe decided to return to our boarding house. We were lucky that we found a small boat floating on the Kyobashi-river. The river was filled with dead bodies and scrap wood. We got off the boat by the iron bridge near Inari-cho. We soaked the facecloth and tied it around our heads to avoid heat, and headed towards Shiden–street.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn our way to the boarding house, all of the wooden houses were burned down, reinforcement concrete buildings were damaged, and burned bodies were lying down everywhere. Among gun smokes and heat winds, we headed south towards our boarding house. Then, I realized that my colleague who came together from the evacuation school was gone. I assume he changed his direction to head towards his house to check whether it was safe.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy wet shirts and pants which I soaked in the river was totally dried up due to the heat, as well as my throat. When I reached Hieizan-street, I looked for a stone gateway that I was familiar of. Although my boarding house was burned down, I was glad that there were no dead bodies around. The landlord’s bicycle and my classmate’s radio were burned down. In addition, wheat flour and a scoop of rice which I kept in an aluminum can in case of emergency were also burned into black and silver powders. I had lost all of my belongings. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI picked up a box nail and a burned board to use it as a pen and a message board. I wrote that my classmate and I are safe and propped it up against the wall so that my colleagues can see. Later, I heard that my classmate passed away about a month after he was involved in the atomic bomb attach.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOne day, an injured woman who had a severe burn and peeled face stopped me by at the boarding house. Since she was heavily injured, I was not able to notice that she was my colleague until she mentioned her name. She also died few days after she returned to work. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen we reached Hieizan bridge, we noticed that the gas tank in Minami-City was left undamaged. No mark of large size bombs or firebombs. I was confused of the gas tank being unharmed because I thought the bombing was aimed for it. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI headed for Ushita where the relatives of my landlord lived. On the way from Koujin-bridge to Hiroshima station, electric railways were totally burned down leaving only the frames, and on the bank of Kyobashi-river, atomic bomb victims were laying down in a row like a railway sleeper. Looking at their charred clothes and peeled skins, I assume they made a harrowing escape from the heat. Hearing the death throes coming from their tumid lips, I thought this exactly was a living hell.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAlthough the house of the landlord’s relative was half broken, I was able to meet with my landlord there. He also had been bombed in the city, and escaped to his relative’s house. Although he was groaning and wriggling due to the pain from his burns, he was still worrying about his wife who was still not found. The cruel August 6th was finally about to end. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNext morning, the landlord’s wife returned safe. She collapsed in tears once she found her husband. We were all happy of her return. She said that she crawled out of the broken house, quickly grabbed her emergency backpack and escaped to the Eastern part of Hieizan to spend the night there.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter I left the landlord’s relative’s house, I wandered around in the rubble from Hacchobori, Kamiyacho to Aioi-bridge. There were many injured people wandering flat footed searching for their families.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe tower of Hiroshima castle was also burned down, and it looked like a lump of scrap wood on top of a stone wall.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSince the sidewalks of the Aioi-bridge was blown off, many injured people rolled into the river from there to cool off their scalded bodies. Tens of naked dead bodies were floating on the river overlapping with each other. Since some of them had their arms to the sky, it looked as if they were imploring for help. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy old school which was located along the Motoyasu-river in Chida-town had barely survived the attack, but most of the building was collapsed and was turned into rubbles. Later I had heard that more than 200 people were killed in that building. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI made a round trip between my office and Hiroshima city for two to three days. Many people were wandering around the city filled with rubble and gun smoke. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe city was filled with terrible odor because most of the dead bodies were cremated. In the night time, I saw burning fires everywhere. The western parade ground was especially terrible. The fire was about 1 meter high, and the phosphorus looked like a small blue bug flying around the dead bodies. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe atomic bomb damned many people to hell in a brink of an eye, and changed the city of Hiroshima into a crematorium. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter I returned to my hometown Onomichi, I suffered from diarrhea and nausea for a while. I also suffered from severe fever and dizziness. Since I had heard many news about atomic bomb casualties, I was prepared to die anytime. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter I recovered from the illness, I returned to school to study architectonics. Since the school building was broken, some of the teachers, staffs, and students who survived the atomic bomb worked together to gather some scrap wood to rebuild a classroom. Even though the classroom neither had ceiling nor flooring, I was able to graduate in 1947 together with 10 classmates. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLooking back, I gave most of my vernal years to the city of Hiroshima which is my second hometown. I went through the atomic bomb, end of war, and the deprivation after the war, together with the city of Hiroshima. </p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">My A-bomb experience</p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">\nIn those days, I lived in Kure-City Hiroshima Prefecture which was located about 26 kilometers southeast from Hiroshima City. Kure was a naval base and there were many battleships anchoring and factories creating weapons and battleships. Kure also had a military airport on the east side of the city. Therefore, Kure often became a target for aerial bombing. We had experienced B29 bombing frequently that most of the military base and battleships were destroyed. Moreover, 80% of the residence were destroyed by the fire bombs. The civilians spent many sleepless nights in fear of the aerial attack. Air superiority was totally in hand of the Americans.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was a student that time. The American Grumman battleplane even strafed to the commuting trains and school grounds.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAugust 6th, I was on the Kure-line train heading for Hiroshima City. Air-raid alarms rang so loudly as usual. By the time I reached Hiroshima station, the alert was canceled and I rushed to the platform of the Hiroshima City line to catch another train. Unfortunately, the trains I wanted to catch just had departed before I arrived. I missed the train only by few meters. (Later, I found out that I was lucky to miss this train because this train becomes burned by the a-bomb.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was in line waiting for the next train. Later, I heard that someone saw B29 battleplane passing over us. I didn’t notice at all. A few minutes later, the train arrived to the platform. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt the exact moment, waves of fire swamped to the platform simultaneously with the train. It is hard to describe what this fire wave looked like. The color was a mix of orange and red. I felt extreme heat and quickly bent myself down to the ground covering my face with my hands. (Later, I had noticed that I was blown off by a strong blast wave. Many people describe the a-bomb as “PIKADON”, but I didn’t hear neither of PIKA nor DON.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAbsolute darkness. I could not see anything. I became anxious that my eyes got crushed. I regained my sight gradually. I had no idea what had happened to me. I looked around, and the sight was horrible. Then, I heard someone saying “Evacuate!! Evacuate!!” So I ran to the nearby bomb shelter. Finally, I noticed that my face soared. I placed my hand to my face. Then I noticed that the skin of my face slipped. I had finally noticed that this is serious.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFew minutes later, I got out of the bomb shelter since outside became silent. It was a totally different world. Houses, shops and the hotel in front of the station were all wrecked, the glass windows of the station were broken, and the wall turned black. One woman was walking with her pants ripped, some had their skin exposed, and some were bleeding from their head and face. In a short while, injured victims started to be delivered by a truck. They were so damaged that they didn’t look like human beings. Some were on the brink of death. The pain on my face was getting worse. My left hand fingers started to blister. People started running around everywhere. Injured people started to wander around in pain. Since public transportation was dead, I started walking towards Kure by following the rail tracks.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAnyway, it was hard to understand what has happened. I had never even imagined such a disaster happening in the middle of the city. When I walked about four kilometers from the station, I found a temporary rescue tent made in the property of Toyo-Industry (Currently, Mazda). So I rushed in. I saw many injured people carried into the tent by a truck. The damage was even worse than what I saw at the station. It was so horrible that I couldn’t believe it was real. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the temporary rescue tent, there were lots of nurses and female students trying to take care of the injured victims, but it seemed like they were bewildered confronting such a disaster which they had no idea what to do. My burn was limited to my hand and half side of the face which was exposed to the heat, as I wore very thick clothing which protected most part of my body. Compared to heavily injured people, I am sure it was much easier to take care of. The nurse washed my burn with an acidum boricum, put oxide ointment and covered it with a cotton gauze. After my first aid treatment was done, I left the tent with painful reluctance worrying about those with fatal damage and wondering how they can be cured. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n《Cure》Around 3 PM, the Kure line got resumed and I decided to take the train to go to the hospital. In the train, I met with a neighbor who worked for Toyo-Industry. I told him what had happened and that I will go to the hospital to get some treatment before going home. So he said he will let my mother know that I was injured. In later years, this conversation became the witness that I was an A-bomb victim, and contributed to the approval of A-bomb survivors health book issuance forty years later.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter I arrived at Kure station, I directly headed to the Kure Mutual Hospital. The doctor diagnosed that my burn was not ordinary. My skin was burned three times that it burned not only the surface of my skin, but also the dermal tissues as well as some part of muscles. In the worst case, I had to be skin grafted by a special physician.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI am sure my mother was anxious. It was fortunate that my neighbor delivered a message to my mother. In addition, my older brother was also in Hiroshima when the bomb dropped. He was working for the National Railway and was at Hiroshima station when the bomb dropped. He was miraculously unharmed, but suffered from after effects later in his life. My younger was in a hospital when the bomb dropped. She was injured by an air-raid by Grumman battleplane when she was on student service. The summer of 1945 was extremely hot. I walked 3 kilometers every day to get treatment at the hospital. The treatment at the hospital involved severe pain. The pain peeling off the gauze from burned out skin was beyond imagination. I still cannot forget the pain today. Under the scorching sun of August, the gauze became crispy and dry every day. These days were a nightmare for me. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was in great pain when the pus on my left hand fingers got worse and the doctor cut off it with a medical scissors. Not only my hands, but my face also became suppurative, that it released a strong odor. Since flies infested to the odor, I had to stay in a mosquito net all day to sleep. Later, I heard that other people also suffered from maggots.（</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFortunately, my burn cured in three to four months. But right half of my face was still reddish and a part of my ear robe was melted. My left hand was also discolored. Since I was still young, my left hand gradually got better year by year. On the other hand, suppurative disease kept me suffering for a while.\nAfter the war, when I regained health, I participated in the rebuilding activities of the school building. On the weekends, I took some part time job and made donations for the A-bomb victims.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter I graduated from school in 1947, I was luckily able to get a job at a electronics manufacturer in Tokyo. Those days, the country suffered from severe food shortage and people in Hiroshima thought going to Tokyo meant death from starvation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n《The meet with「The Hachioji Hibakusha Association」》I didn’t even know the existence of such association until the President and the executive officer visited me in 1993.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was a very tough work for me to obtain the A-bomb survivors health book that it took me two years from application. With the support from my witness, I finally received the book in 1985. The receptionist gave me a favor to specially allow third degree kinship to witness that I was exposed to the A-bomb. My mother gave me a phone call frequently to apply for the health book as her had heard many A-bomb victims suffered from after effects.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI participate in the activities of the A-bomb victims because I don’t want my family, the Japanese citizen, furthermore all humankind to go through what I had experienced. Like I mentioned, I moved to the Kure area after the bomb, so I haven’t directly seen how the city of Hiroshima was like after the bomb. Therefore when I participate in exhibitions or occasion to talk about the a-bomb experience, I often quote other victim’s experience or some information that I got from books. But what I told today is all based on my own experience.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere is nothing awful than war. There is no line between battle field and inland. Everyone gets harmed equally. Of course, the country which becomes the battlefield is more awful. I get scared just thinking about nuclear missiles passing above us. In order to maintain peace, true democracy is necessary for the civilians and politicians to make the right decision time to time. The Manchurian Incident erupted in 1927. Counting from then, I was involved in war more than ten years since I was in kindergarten. After all these years, I strongly feel the preciousness of peace.\n</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

Doors and shelves collapsed making a tremendous noise, and we all evacuated outside.  Our house was in flames soon after we got out. We decided to evacuate towards the seaside along the main street. On the way, we saw many injured and dead people, but I don’t remember it clearly. We slept outside for a few days. In the daytime, people started to clean up the rubble when the fire burned out. Dead bodies were put on the ground in a row along the main street. There was no light during the night and the city was silent. There were some moribund people lying in the row of the dead bodies even though they were still alive. I heard them say “Give me water.” or “Help me.” However, there was nothing I could do. I spent a few nights under those circumstances. I had enough water since it was bursting out of the underground pipes, but lack of food was severe. We caught wild chickens running around and boiled them by using an iron helmet as a pot. Then we moved to our father’s hometown (Kanda Village). Although many people were injured or burned, we helped each other to survive. Some of them suffered from maggots growing in a wound and crawling over their skin one after another. I helped them remove maggots but they died eventually. Those who could remove most of maggots survived with keloids. \nLater I found out that all people in the neighboring houses died. They burned to death trapped under collapsed houses. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I was a child, I did not have any health problems. However, when I got older, the after effects of the A-bomb surely eroded my body. In fact, I once suffered from a lack of white blood cells. I also had a hard time when I got married because I was an A-bomb survivor. When I had a baby, I was very anxious because of the possibility of the health effects to my baby. As I had anticipated, my child had several health problems. I was shocked to hear that my best friend who was also an A-bomb survivor died of low white blood cell count last year.\nIt is insane for humans to kill each other. It goes without saying that I am opposed to war, and I am opposed to using nuclear weapons, since it leaves ever-lasting negative effects on future generations. I’m sure that nuclear weapons will bring about the destruction of mankind.\n</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

Then a shower of glass fragments pierced my body. The shattered glass slithered out all over the floor. I ran barefoot on the broken glass to get out of school and headed for my house. The moment I got out of school and stood on the national route in front of our school, I was surprised to see a horrible sight.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\"> A naked man with a blackened body was walking aimlessly. A woman was crying and running dragging her child. People were running bleeding. Their clothes were ripped. Nobody looked normal.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\"> Since my house was located in the center of Hiroshima, I had to head towards the opposite direction from the people screaming and groaning, who were escaping from the epicenter. Many people said to me, “Don’t go that way! It’s dangerous! Let’s escape together this way!” However, I didn’t listen to them and finally made my way home. \n\n\n\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">My house was located on the top of a hill which was only three kilometers away from center of Hiroshima. It was blown apart from the floor to the ceiling by the blast. So I could not get in. My father had been killed in action in 1944 and I lived with nine family members in that house; my grandparents, mother, older sister, myself, three younger brothers and a sister who was just two years old. My family had to spend that night in a bamboo grove next to the ruins of my house. \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">From the very next day, my grandfather visited the epicenter everyday with his two-wheeled cart to look for his neighbors and acquaintances. The stories he told me were horrible. The road was filled with people so badly injured that they couldn’t be identified. They grabbed his legs asking for help. A baby sucking a mother’s breast, not knowing the mother was already dead. My grandfather lamented that he could not do anything for them.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">One day, my grandfather brought home two dead bodies on his cart. Both of the bodies were badly charred with their arms and legs pointed to the sky, as if they were asking for help.\n\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">They were his friend, Tokie’s father and brother. Although more than sixty years has passed, I cannot forget Tokie’s wailing in sorrow and sadness.\n\n</p><p class=\"body_en\"> A few days later, our school’s students were requested to help the rescue center which was temporarily made at Honkawa Elementary School near the Atomic Bomb Dome. The rescue center was nothing but just concrete blocks, the ruins of the school building. So we put some carpets on the blocks and served some rice soup to the injured people with maggots in their wounds, surrounded by dead bodies tied together with ropes. \n</p><p class=\"body_en\"> At that time, I was just fourteen years old. I was worried whether I could hide what I really felt.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\"> When the atomic bomb dropped, my mother was working in the rice field and she instantly jumped into a ditch to escape from the blast. She accidently swallowed black water polluted with radiation, which was called “Black Rain.” She suddenly coughed up blood and died two years after the bomb was dropped.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The sight of my younger sister following her friend’s mother saying “mommy, mommy” always broke my heart.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Since then I started to suffer from headaches and vomiting from an uncertain cause. I had been diagnosed by many research laboratories which studied radiation effects on humans. They didn’t tell me any diagnosis and treatment, so I felt as if I were just a guinea pig. \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I had heard that there were approximately 4,500 orphans who lost their parents by the A-bomb, and that those orphans starved and begged for food near Hiroshima Station. I cannot imagine how desperate they felt, losing their parents, brothers, houses, and food to eat in the blink of an eye. I feel bitter remorse that I could not do anything for them at all at that time. \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I always keep it in mind that a number of children are involved in war or are suffering from starvation. I believe that it is my mission to hand down the horror of the A-bomb to the next generations to keep our descendants from going through the same disaster. I am determined to spread the peace movement against war and nuclear weapons.\n\n\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Now, as the second generation of atomic bomb victims, my four children, are contributing to society. That is proof of my victory over the tragedy of A-bomb radiation sickness.\n</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\">5 days after in Hiroshima</p><p class=\"body_en\">Early morning, 5 days after the bomb was dropped, my father absolutely opposed the idea for me to go to Hiroshima as it was extremely dangerous. However it was my mother’s adamant decision that her, myself and my younger sister head to Hiroshima. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt that time, my family of five, my parents myself and my sisters lived in Kure City Hiro-cho just a little ways from Hiroshima. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy father’s home was located in Hiroshima City limits, Fukushima-cho along with all my relatives lived in the area. Many have told us to avoid the Hiroshima City limits as everyone will die by breathing the poisonous gases. We were skeptical as we just wanted to see how it was like as we did not know what the current situation was. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe finally boarded the train however midway, we thought that it was Umidashi Station but the train could not pass and we were told to disembark.  We all encouraged each other we moved forward. We were slowly welcomed by a strange scenery ahead, I doubted myself  that this was Hiroshima however hearing the screaming voices nearby all I can do was be speechless with the sudden change of\nscenery. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs far as the eye can see, there were remains of charred tree trunk skeletons in the burning fields. When I saw the smoldering ashes from the trees, deep down in my heart, I wished that that this was all a\ndream. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs I continued to walk I became worn out from the heat and exhaustion and saw a train on its side. On the roof of the train I can see something black wriggle and buzz around. As I peered closer, I saw that\nthere were thousands, no, tens of thousands of maggots and flies circling in clusters of swarms in the area. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nRecalling these memories, it makes me want to vomit. We wondered around all day without doing anything, all that lay there was the horrible truth of our Hiroshima, a picture of hell. I could not shed a tear, all I though was to escape from this place with all my heart. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter that I do not remember at all how I got home. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe story I heard after that was that my grandmother and every one of my relatives had severe burns all over their bodies. It has been a while since I’ve seen my grandmother. When I saw her, vast Keloidal scarring was evident on her body, I didn’t think it was scary but I had goose bumps just thinking about it. Living dizzily for 60 years as society whisks by, the images of the past are still fresh in my mind as it\nfeels like it was yesterday I saw it in front of my eyes. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I saw the local naval shipyard attacked by aerial bombs and bloodied friends in the volunteer troops being carried in stretchers, my trembling could not stop. Memories of us hugging and crying together, a memory I can never forget. Back then I worked at the Hiro Naval Arsenal General Affairs Department, General Affairs section as a typist. I worked with 2 other female students from other schools (one was named Miyoko Kaneko, and I cannot remember the name of the second one) and we were always known as the “good friend trio” as we worked hard daily. Secretary Saito was one of the best bosses I ever had. I always thought the important people who were decorated with plenty of medals on their chest were scary. However, Lieutenant Colonel Kabayama, First Lieutenant Miao, Captain Hayashida, First Lieutenant Okita, Second Lieutenant Yamashita and Sergeant Okada were all kind people to me. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEventually, I settled in Kagoshima. When I returned to my hometown in Hiroshima to have surgery on my left middle finger for whitlow, the doctor angrily scolded me and said, “You’re an atomic bomb victim\nright? You should have told us earlier” because my bleeding did not stop. When I removed a tooth, again my bleeding did not stop and I cause an inconvenience to the doctor. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThey said that neither vegetation nor human life can be sustained around Hiroshima for 70 years after the atomic bomb was dropped. However, it’s an exciting thing where a miracle happened as Hiroshima’s reconstruction gained world attention. On the other hand, I question what happened on that summer day when I was 17 years old.

        "description": "<div class=\"balloon\"><div class=\"shogen\"><p class=\"subject\"> Leaving my 60s, one can never forget that day, that moment</p>\n<p class=\"image\"><img src=\"data/photo/tokuko_toyosaki2.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">Day of Hell</p><p class=\"body_en\">August 6th, 1945, after my mother left for her work as a building evacuation employee, my grandfather and I just completed eating breakfast. As I felt a sign of relief after the air raid warnings ceased, then suddenly, it became pitch black right in front of my eyes. A very strong gust of wind blew me to the ground. Without thinking I screamed “mother” as loud as I can and at the same time my grandfather screamed “duck”!! </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFor a second I thought a hell bomb dropped in front of our house. After a while I lifted my head and saw that there as noting but flat land around me in rubbles with a large cloud of dust and smoke. Finally, after it started to clear, the first thing that startled me was that the second floor of my house was about to fall over. The floor in the room next to me, gave out and the furniture that was in the room just sank to the floor. I could see the neighbors interior and both of our houses were exposed as it felt like a large earth quake hit the region. I realized I was bleeding from all over. I did not know where I was bleeding from however looking down on my left wrists, it looked as if it was inside of a pomegranate fruit cut in half and the outer layers looked like chicken throat freshly cut from its neck. I did not feel any pain at that time, I pulled out a cloth and wrapped it around hoping that the bleeding would stop. But the bleeding wouldn’t stop as the blood slowly started to drip to the ground. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThen I can see that there were walls of fire that sprung from the ground. As there was a significant risk that the gas tanks located at the gas plants nearby were going to explode, I got on an army truck and took refuge at a Red Cross facility. On the way near Hijisan bridge, I saw the female students who attended the schools nearby. I could not decipher weather it was skin or clothes on them as it hanged from their body, they were calling, “help us soldiers please, please let us on” as they cried to us. The soldiers hesitantly calmed the girls and said to wait until the next truck comes, as I can remember this sight as it has been eternally burned in my mind. The other passengers in the truck, I can feel the tension from them as I myself was curled up and trembling with fear. As I watched the people who were caring for the badly burned on the truck, they yelled at me saying. “Don’t cry as it’s not that bad. There are more people on here who are severely hurt so get off.” With no choice, my grandfather and I got off around Ujina and went to the triumphal building (Gaisenkan, temporary first aid station at the time) however there were soo many people who were severely hurt there as well we ended up slowly trudged along the path to our half crumbled home.  One we got home, my grandfather treated me with a common household medication commonly named “Takonosuidashi” (a form of Chinese herbal medicine) and applying this on my skin. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat night I had a severe fever and I could not raise my arm. I spent my days in fear as the city skies burned at night. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy mother was smashed under the very building she worked at. She was severely wounded and had multiple glass pieces stuck on her back from the blast. Luckily someone passed by and pulled her out from the rubble. With all the commotion in the city, it’s a miracle she returned home. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was relieved to see that my grandfather had light injuries and all three returned home safely. </p><p class=\"body_en\"> \nThe next day, I got in a line where the Japanese Army was giving out canned bread treats. During this time, the entire governmental system ceased operations. The governmental employees were all dazed and confused from the incident, however all of people who survived, including the soldiers, helped us all out. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n<<Searching for the hospital where my father was getting treatment, passing of my grandfather and after the end of the war>> It’s painful, although my house escaped the ravaging fire that swept the neighborhood, living in a house where it’s on the verge of collapse and looking at the naked stars at night is something. We cannot fix the roof and even after when it rains the tatami rots. I sleep next to mushrooms that have sprouted on the tatami. No relatives nearby to help, I cannot return to my hometown in Nagasaki as I have decided to completely stay in Hiroshima. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs the fire slowly died down four to five days after the blast, everyday my mother and I held hands and searched my father’s hospital. The army hospital where my father was supposedly being treated was easily accessible from Minamimachi as you can get there by walking along the city tram tracks. We looked around the west square, all the way around coming from behind Gokoku Shrine for the hospital but all we saw were burning fields. Nothing else can be seen. We walked all round searching areas including a small evacuation shelter set up at around Koi, Eba, Dohashi and Yokogawa. By the time we got home I was exhausted. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOne time when I was walking around Ootemachi and Kamiya-cho, I came across a charred body crushed by the fallen building. When I saw the body, my vision blurred as I looked at the puffed up stomach and thought it looks like a plump fish that was cooked around a camp fire. When I think about this now, the devil was definitely playing around with me. I thought I should be punished by god. Around several dead bodies, there was one who stuck his head out and his eyes slowly looked towards me. I saw that the clothes on the body, the pajama pattern was burned directly on the skin and some parts of the clothes left tattered on the body. This started me when I saw this sight. I also saw on the floor of the Fukuya Department Store, a charred suffocating person, burned with dark brown skin, curled up and wriggling around asking for “water water” in a soft voice. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFor us, we wanted to check to see if this was our father’s face…..so we looked at each person carefully and thoroughly, our hearts were so bitter from looking at so many charred remains and faces. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nEventually the city tram began to resume operations. Maggots began to infest the dead bodies littered around the city where they eventually became flies and swarmed around the ceiling of the train, wriggling and flying around. Normally you will see a beautifully painted white ceiling, however when you looked up it was black with flies and maggots swarming around while below humans were stuffed like a sardine can in the train. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhat I am writing now is what most of the A-bomb victims and their families have experienced in Hiroshima. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter the end of the war, I forgot what day it was but school somehow resumed. However, since the classrooms were a wreck, we took the chairs that made it through the blast and took them out to the school ground to participate in classes. Sessions were divided where during the AM it was the lower grade levels and the PM was the upper grade levels. Since there was no roof above us, there was no school when it rained and our textbooks were hand written by the teacher himself. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere were teachers who passed away as well as teachers who were missing. Because of this, one teacher was taking care of all grade levels. There were also students who were badly injured. Some students had severely burned skins from the fire, some with Keloid sickness, some who smelled and were suffering from malnutrition, and there were some who had severe lice and scabs. In order to prevent the spread of skin diseases, all students at the school were sprayed with DDT head to toe.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAnyway, I was filled with the of feeling of relief that I survived these treacherous conditions. I would of never imagined how my life would be after that the death of grandfather and my mother who had A-bomb sickness. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy grandfather was very healthy prior to when the atomic bomb fell however two weeks later, he suddenly had a high fever and had continuous diarrhea from his intestines that seemed to me were partially melted away. He did not have the strength to drink water and gradually became skinnier and lost weight significantly. He was so anorexic that it was inevitable for him to pass away. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHe was completely conscience of his condition and was constantly yelling, “I don’t want to die” however right before he passed, my mother said softly, “Grandpa do you understand, it will be ok”. “Yes, yes he replied and nodded. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter that he passed away in his sleep. The town doctor gave him an autopsy and noted that it was accelerated atomic radiation sickness. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was on the afternoon of September 19th, 1945, he was 63 years old. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe people, who could not live in their completely destroyed homes, built temporary roofs and barracks and lived without electricity. Since we couldn’t make our grandpas coffin, we had the help from the neighborhood association leader who was kind enough to make one out of the board scraps lying around. He then helped us load it in to a trailer towed by a bicycle and took it to the crematory over at Motoujina Island. Since it was summer, the dead body odor swarmed all over us as memories of pity and not wanting to do this slowly ran in my mind. Until my grandfather died, this sight was something that was burned to the deep end of my beain and would never separate from my life. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHowever, at that time, in the mist of all the deaths along with the missing people, I remember in the house, with a sad face my mother told me in the midst of death in front of us, “be thankful for the small mercies”.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter my grandfather died, I heard that my father, who I thought passed away, was alive from an organization affiliated with the army hospital. At the same time after the war, the army hospitals all ceased its operations. They were then ordered to help all the families who were still surviving in the area. My father was taking shelter at a nearby junior high school which was converted in to a temporary army hospital. My father worked aboard a ship which made frequent visits to other countries however when the war started to take a toll, the company he worked for recruited all their employees to the army and was converted to make trips for the wounded from the south. I heard from my father that after they dropped off the wounded they carried weapons and medication from inner Japan to the ports. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy father’s wounds were from when his boat was docked at Kainan island and was hit by torpedo, exploded and was half way sinking in the ocean, was luckily saved and picked up as he was floating unconscientiously nearby. We would never hear of this as we were living scarcely day by day on the mainland trying to get by. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe story will go back a little but one lonely soldier visited us one day in early 1945 who told us that my father was badly wounded and was carried to an army hospital somewhere near the city of Beppu. My mother and I visited him in Beppu one time and since we lived in Hiroshima, the hospital advised my father to be transferred to an army hospital nearby. We found out that our father was a little ways from the national railway, Geibi Line, Miyoshi Station. At a junior high school near the station, a very nice local villager helped us get home in two days. At that time, when you stay at some someones house, you typically offer rice as a sort of payment. I remember as a child my mother having a hard time asking the people to let us stay. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy father posing as a disabled soldier wearing hospital clothes was released from the hospital in crutches. If he were being treated at the army hospital, he would have been labeled as an Atomic bomb victim for sure. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs my father was released from the hospital with half his injuries treated, he lay on his side every day in pain. In order to survive, my mother frantically searched for clothes from our half wrecked home and went to the country side to exchange potatoes and Japanese pumpkins. This type of life style continued for a while. Literally this surviving by selling one’s clothes continued as my clothes as well as my mother’s Japanese style clothes, every day clothes, koto and musical notes were all traded for food. Also, the rising inflation took away all our savings and the government bonds were all reduced to ashes in value. This led everyone to reach out to the black markets for rice and in order to save money, conduct illegal activities. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAs a non-local, I was bullied in elementary school quite often. My father who was recuperating, part of his foot was bent and become a few inches shorter. From his heel, the bone was sticking out. It was scrapped many times which then lead to him having problems walking. It was painful seeing the local kids who lived nearby see my father and flee from sight. However there were certain kind friends who saved me. With all this happening around me as a child, I grew up being tough kid in the neighborhood. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the end, I knew my mother protected me as well. Even though she was weak, she would help the tuberculosis patients as a chaperon at the local hospital every month. She also went on trips to sell things to help support our family. From 1947, my mother also repeatedly was treated at the hospital as well. When she couldn’t pay the hospital bill, she would leave, make enough to pay for her treatment and then return to receive further treatment. With my mother doing this every day, it was always just my father and I at home. However, in 1954 all of sudden my father took his last breath.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNo matter where you are or where you are from, war tears peoples’ lives apart and makes people crazy. Sounds a little like today if you ask me…</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn one way or another, it was all because of my mother I was raised to be not that sensitive about things. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n<<Mother’s atomic bomb sickness and after>> One day, My mother, perhaps it was the lack of malnutrition or the suppurating pimples from her body, started to complain that she got fatigued quite often. We had her checked at the Atomic Bomb victim’s hospital where she was diagnosed with aplastic anemia. This lead to her taking a break from her activities and she was to be treated as soon as possible. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAround 1970, my mother showed signs of breast cancer and had her right breast removed. She was then diagnosed with A-bomb cataract and lost her eye sight. She has second degree dysopia and required a white cane to walk around. As she grew older, she would become weak and would visit hospitals frequently. However in 1990, she fell while taking a bath and was rushed to the hospital. The fall resulted in a mild heart attack and at the same time cancer was found on her left breast which in May was removed. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter that my mother removed both of her breasts and in order to prevent the spread to the lymph nodes, she had a large operation. She walked with a bent waist, always looking down. After the operation, it didn’t stop there. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nShe has fought with this kind of sickness throughout her entire life. However even though she kept saying “I’m ok” all these years, it has been 40 years since I’ve come to Tokyo all that time my mother continued to live all by herself in Hiroshima. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt one point, she thought that retired life would be sad and lonely. However after living 65 years, she found a purpose for her second life by participating in the Hiroshima Atomic Bomb victims associations’ events. As a catholic, my mother would attend mass every Sunday with the association’s head (at that time) Mr. Kotabe and also participate in events with the other members by getting signatures from visitors outside the associations office building. She also participated in demonstrations aimed towards the government compensations for A-bomb victims and going to the national diet to fulfill demands on petitioning for this movement. She would come to Tokyo often to participate in these events. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI think nuclear weapons which result in nuclear wars should not be part of this earth. At that time, she couldn’t see very well and relied heavily on a cane to get around. The leading members from organization and others who participated in the events were struggling at many events, but because of their help and they were all there, she would participate in the events. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn 1982, my mother along with catholic sisters from Hiroshima, participated in the Special Session on Disarmament of the United Nations General Assembly as representatives of the Atomic Bomb victims. There at New York’s central park, 1 million people gathered along with my mother and her cane, to protest against nuclear weapons at the “No more Hiroshima, No more Nagasaki, No more War” rally.  That’s the time when rallies were hot, along with European countries, protested against nuclear weapons worldwide. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy mother at that time, sacrificed a lot by not only protesting in Japan, but against the world at places like Greece, Italy, Canada and Israel, and spoke about her atomic bomb experience for the anti-nuclear world peace movement. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter that back in Hiroshima she participated in the “speaking clubs” where she did interviews with foreign correspondents and received letters from students detailing their experience on their Hiroshima school trip. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen she was young, she was pretty big for her size however was always physically weak. She survived the treacheries of war, which caused her explode in anger as a Hiroshima A-bomb victim. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen my mother was in Hiroshima, she loved the younger generation who would come in and out and listen to my mother’s unique way of talking.  She was called the “Tominaga Setsu” by them. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy mother was repeatedly admitted to the hospital, however the doctor who would always perform her checkups said, “she has had breast cancer twice and had it removed and have other sicknesses now however she continues to fight and overcome them.” </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt 88, my mother finally came to live with me. She slowly got used to the environment however one day she would break a bone and taking care of her at home got difficult. With that, after she fully recovered at the hospital, I admitted her to a retirement home in 2001. In 2002, I transferred her to an elderly intensive care home. 2 months later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer and all of sudden her body was getting weak and was dying from an illness. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI am sure that the change of environment had an effect where she always held some kind of uncertainty. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn life, old and young alike, my mother lived a life where she was saved by many people around her. She would always thank the people around her by repeating, “thank you, thank you,” everywhere she went. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt the age of 90, she passed away. I believe her life was never wasted as she always felt that it was her life duty, life purpose to continue the storytelling club. She definitely had her own uniqueness along with her strong characteristic however I believe she did not the live the life as she wanted to. As there were the A-bomb victims who have already died and all the people who helped out at the association were still there, we the second generation A-bomb victims, feel that we are blessed to carry on this responsibility.  </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nTaking on my mother’s role is something I am not good at. Of course the elimination of nuclear weapons is important however I feel that I need to continue fighting, taking over from our predecessors for the class action lawsuit against the government acknowledging the a-bomb sickness victims and events that deal with government reparations for the a-bomb victims.</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

She also lost her husband by disease when she was thirty two. Although she had struggled with the burden of single parenthood, she had put all of her effort to raise her three children. Unfortunately, she lost one of her son by A-bomb. After the war, she had struggled from the after effects of the A-bomb radiation and passed away at the age of thirty five. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the day the A-bomb dropped to Hiroshima, my mother was at her house in Minamitakeya town, Hiroshima, together with my younger brother who was thirteen years old. My younger sister who was a sixth grader at that time was out of town on a student evacuation. I was on my third year at a junior high school. I was working as a mobilized student at the army ammunition depot located in Itsukushima town which was a suburb of Hiroshima. That day, I was luckily able to avert A-bomb since I was on duty.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the day the A-bomb dropped, both my mother and my younger brother were on duty by municipal order at a building demolition site. They were assigned to work at a site near the hypocenter.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was a hot morning with burning sun. My mother later told me that she saw some kind of flash when the bomb dropped. She didn’t remember what had happened after that. I assume my younger brother went through the same situation as he was also working at a demolition site near the hypocenter. My mother told me that she suddenly found herself in ripped and burned clothes, and a severe burn on her upper body including her neck and arm. She told me that my brother’s injury was more severe. My mother was also heavily injured that her right leg’s bone was broken.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nShe told me that both her any my brother dragged their feet for more than 500 meters to reach their home.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLater, I had heard that my mother and brother headed towards Ujina area to go to the Hiroshima army mutual aid hospital. Considering the fact that nobody knew where my brother died, I assume he was heavily injured. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNext day, I headed to Ujina from Itsukushima by ship to look for my family in the death city of Minamitakeya town where my family’s house was located. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was luckily able to meet with a neighbor who told me that my mother and brother went to the mutual aid hospital. When I arrived at the hospital, it was filled with A-bomb victims and their families. Some were dead, and some were on the brink of death from severe burn that I could not even recognize their sex. I pushed those people through to look for my family. I looked through the hospital’s courtyard to all of the patient’s rooms and was finally able to find my mother on the second floor, laying on a bed.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHer face and hair was so black and damaged that I could not believe it was the same person I met only two or three days ago. I asked her where my brother is, and she told me that they were together until they reached this hospital, but he used up all of his energy to reach the hospital entrance. I assumed he passed away on that day. I looked around the hospital two to three times with slight hope, but finally was not able to find him.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAlthough my mother was heavily injured, I was in relief that I was able to meet with my mother alive, and slept alongside with her for a while. The treatment at the hospital was not enough. So I asked other victim’s family members for advice how to treat the burn and how to feed the injured. My mother was able to make simple communication for a week and took food. But from three or four days before her death, she lost her words and did not take any food at all. I had recognized that her death is near. When I was taking care of my moribund mother, flies frequently laid eggs to my mother’s back and many maggots hatched. She often asked me to get rid of those crawling maggots as it made pain to her back. My biggest regret to her is that I only took one or two of them away and lied to her that I took care of all of them. I still feel sorry for her and regret that I should have carried out her last wish. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAugust 19th. I think it was around 10AM. My dearest mother passed away when I was taking a little catnap along with her. I didn’t have a feel of disappointment. I just stood dumbfounded in a stupor. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI assumed that people around had called the nurse, three or four soldiers came into our room and took my mother to a small hill outside of the hospital. We gathered some woods to use for cremation and one soldier started to read a quick sutra for my mother. Two hours later, I picked up her bones all by myself and headed to Ujina, where my uncle lived.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nRest in peace, mother and brother.</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

Since August 6th was a day off, I returned to my home in Nukushina town which is located about five kilometers from the hypocenter. I was in a deep sleep. When I woke up by the bomb, shutter doors and paper doors were blown into pieces, ceiling were torn off, and the clay wall of my house broken and laying down on the floor. I was lucky that I was not injured.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSince the shock of the bomb was so strong, I thought that the bomb must have dropped somewhere near. I got out of my house to check where the hypocenter was, but there was no sign of bombing around. When I looked at the sky, I saw three parachutes flowing from south to north. I was talking with my neighbors that “B29 planes must have crashed in the sky” “But the air-raid alarm had just been released”. We had no idea what has happened. Just then when we looked up at the sky of Hiroshima, we saw a gold cloud shaped like a doughnut, and a dark black smoke rising above. The doughnut shaped cloud disappeared shortly after, and became a mushroom shaped cloud.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAbout an hour after the mushroom cloud, injured victims of the bomb started to appear. When I asked them “Which city was attacked by the bomb? ”, all of them answered differently. They all said that the bomb had dropped on their hometown. Since they could not imagine that this widespread damage was caused by only one single bomb, all of the victims thought that their town was the hypocenter. Since I suddenly got worried about my younger sister who went to school in Hiroshima this morning, I decided to go look for her. I think it was around 10 AM. I put my safety hood on and jumped onto my bicycle. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nRoad to Hiroshima city was filled with injured people. The burn victims staggered along, holding their arms up in front, and their skin hanging like tattered cloth. They looked like a march of ghosts. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

After a while, I heard a siren so I was looking out the window of the office located in the 2nd floor of the school. I thought I saw B-29 above. I am sure I heard the blast.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe minute I took my shirt off and looked inside the classroom, my body was blown off. It was so sudden that I didn’t feel any flash light or blast. I came back to consciousness 30 to 40 minutes after the blast. I was blown off all the way from the window to the hallway. The stairway was so damaged that I had to slide down the arm rail that was barely left in order to get to the first floor. Since I didn’t have my shirt on and my back exposed to the window, I had a severe burn from the back of my neck to my hip. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAlthough I had a 30 centimeter size burn on my back, I didn’t suffer much from pus or pain because compared to other parts of your body, back is a part where there is not much action. On the other hand, people that had burns on their bellies suffered from extreme pain when they breathe, or even when they sit down or sleep.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLater I also experienced my hair coming off. I returned to duty when my back burn healed. Many soldiers had been evacuated to the mountains. They had bomb shelters in the mountains and there were food. On the way to the bomb shelter, I saw radioactive black rain. After a while, I moved to Kabe-town. Military medics brought 10 to 15 dead bodies every day for cremation. I was in a disconsolate mood every day. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the night of August 6th, I was placed in a hospital in Mirorii. The doctor told me to eat pickled plums and drink lots of water until you have a diarrhea. The doctor knew the bomb had some negative effect to the human body, so he tried to clean up my stomach by drinking lots of water. My life was saved by him. I still appreciate him as my life saver. After I passed the age of seventy, I had cancer and few other illnesses.

I was at Sendamachi Hiroshima which is about two kilometers apart from the epicenter. I was student at a nursing school and lived in a Red Cross dormitory. That time I was suffering from dysentery and had just been discharged from the hospital. The dormitory collapsed by the blast of the bomb and I was trapped under the rubble. I lost consciousness. I don’t know how much time passed, but I heard my roommate calling my name “Ogawa san! Ogawa san!” She told me that she found my leg hanging out from the rubble. When she pulled me out with all her might, I had many scars and was nearly naked. \nEverything around was blown off by the blast. I saw many people with their hands or legs ripped off. There were people with their eyeballs popping out, and their skins burnt out by the heat. I heard sobbing and groaning everywhere. A person on a brink of death was groaning and asked me for a glass of water. The train was burned black with its customers. My roommate Ms. Sato and I walked along the railway to Kaita city and took a train around 5PM to go to Kure city which my grandparents lived. I arrived in Kure city around 8PM.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter the atomic bomb, I didn’t have period for about a year and a half. I suffered from hair loss for about half a year. I also suffered from headache, backache and numbness in a limb. I was also diagnosed as lumber spine diastrophic curvature, and I am still under treatment. When I was in my thirties, I always suffered from a feeling of unwellness due to high blood pressure, but I was able to work as a nurse until the retirement age. Thinking about my classmates who died of the atomic bomb without fulfilling their ambition to be a nurse, I thought I had to fulfill my duty for them.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter I got married, I was had one son and two daughters. When I gave birth to them, I prayed to god every day that my children will be born healthy. Fortunately, my children grew up healthy both physically and mentally.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe hell on August 6th does not end that day. The cruelty of nuclear weapon is that it continues to kill people for decades. People do not have an understanding that the damage and pain still continues. Hiroshima and Nagasaki has the right and responsibility to call for nuclear abolition. I am anxious of our world’s future because the fear of nuclear weapon is becoming bigger and bigger. I hope that this world can live in peace without nuclear weapons.</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

I thought that our country was doomed. Since the military training in Kanazawa finished, I left there on the tenth and arrived in Hiroshima on the eleventh for practical training. Looking at the city of Hiroshima which was burnt to the ground by war, I keenly felt that Japan is heading towards extinction. I also felt that nuclear weapons should never be used again.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was able to receive the survivors health book in 1996. I still take health examination twice a year. Since I was diagnosed as diabetes one time, I regularly take blood sampling and urine sampling, and continue diet therapy as well. In addition, I practice jujutsu since junior high school to keep my health.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe fear of nuclear weapon is getting bigger and bigger. As an A-bomb survivor, what we can do is to support other victims, promote friendship among survivors, and to appeal to the world for the abolition of nuclear weapons, praying for world peace. As an A-bomb victim who experienced the cruelty of A-bomb, we should keep praying that nuclear weapons will never be used again. But the average age of the A-bomb survivors has already surpassed seventy. I can feel that we are gradually losing our strength and energy. I strongly feel that I need to pass down my experience to the younger generation while my health is still good. That is why I started to tell my story to students from elementary to high school. All I wish is that all the A-bomb victims to stay healthy both mentally and physically, and that they live in peace. I hope that can contribute to abolition of nuclear weapons from the world.</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

On August 6th, 1945, my father was 32, mother 25, myself 3 years and 25 days, and my younger brother only 8months and 5 days. Our morning started as usual. My father left home for work, and my mother and I was preparing to go to the nearby river to wash my brother’s diapers. I had two rice balls in my small backpack and a water flask around my neck, and was waiting for my mother at the front door. Later, my mother told me that she was struggling to piggyback my brother. Just when my mother thought of lulling my brother, we experienced a strong light, as if we were exposed to a flash of a camera. “What is this??” My mother was so in panic that she dropped my brother to the floor. Since her forehead was exposed to the radiation, she still has a coin size burn in her forehead.  I am not sure how much time had passed since the bomb dropped. I remember roving around the main street with my mother, who was piggybacking my brother. There were children running around crying for pain, and people begging me for some water. There were some people who wore ripped clothing and walking with their skins hanging down like peeled potato skin. I am not sure whether we should call it “burn”. There were injured people gushing out from everywhere. Ota-river was filled with futons(Japanese style sleeping mat). Buildings were burning. Trucks were running carrying so many dead bodies on the rear deck like a mannequin. That was the sight of August 6th, 1945 that I remember. I am not sure how my parents met after the bomb. But I am sure that none of our family members ever talked about the incident in Hiroshima since then. I didn’t want to hear about it.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt school, I was discriminated as an atomic bomb victim. I didn’t want to write an absence report to go to the annual health diagnosis for a-bomb victims. I unwillingly went until when I was 7th grade, but after that, I stopped going to health checks. A-bomb victims have to face with heavy burden. My badge as an A-bomb victim always became an obstacle for me in major life events such as marriage and childbirth. But I am sure that my parents had more painful life.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThat mother started to take initiative to talk about her experience to children when she turned sixty five. I regret that I should have listened to her story more often. No, I might have heard. I was just closing my heart not to hear. I gnaw from regret that I didn’t listen to her story. My father died at the age of eighty one, which was fifty one years after the bomb. My mother died four years after my father’s death. She was eighty three.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy parents gave me the A-bomb survivors health book and told me to keep it very importantly. I hesitated to use it when I was young, but now it has become something that I cannot live without. It is a treasure from my parents.</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

On the 5th of August, I was called for the cleanup of school evacuation in Hiroshima. I was supposed to help the cleanup next day as well, but was so tired that I couldn’t get up from bed that morning. Next moment, I heard an airplane noise. I felt strange because the air raid warning sign was off. All of a sudden, I jumped off my bed because I felt an indescribable flash. Just when I saw my younger brother running straight towards me for help, my house started to collapse. I don’t quite remember how I got out of my house as I was so desperate. Anyway, I made myself out of the rubble and looked around to check whether my family was safe. First, I heard my younger brother crying. Then I heard my younger sister crying as well. Relying on their crying noise, I was able to rescue both of them out of the rubble. But my grandmother was trapped deep inside. I asked for help, but no one offered. So I decided to rescue her on my own. The sky was gray and the city was filled with ashes. I was right in the middle of the hypocenter. I still wonder how a thirteen year old girl was able to rescue her grandmother out from the heavy rubbles. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter I rescued my grandmother, I was lost in abstraction for a while. But since the flames were spreading, we had to evacuate somewhere. I piggybacked my two year old sister and pulled my five year old brother’s hand to look for somewhere safe. Grandmother was with us first, but we lost each other on the way. The sight we saw on the way was horrible. It cannot be expressed by words.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSince one of my neighbor had a small shelter in Koi-town, we decided to evacuate there for a while together with some of the other neighbors. But the shelter was broken so we had to spend the night outside. I was glad that I was able to reunite with my grandmother on that day, but we spend the following three days outside. Our family patiently waited for my mother to return. My mother was thirty seven years old at that time and worked at the Hiroshima meteorological observatory. But that day, she happened to be at Hiroshima prefectural office.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSince we couldn’t stay at the neighbor’s shelter for a long time, we headed to Miyauchi village which was designated as the community evacuation area, worrying about our mother. We spend one night in Miyauchi village and headed to Muzuuchi village which is my grandmother’s home town. By the time we reached Mizuuchi village, my grandmother was so exhausted that she was prostrated for few days. In addition, my younger brother caught a fever. I had to take care of all of my family members. It was painful just to wash all of their clothes and sheets. I remember I was crying every day from the agony and the sadness that my mother is not found.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy grandmother died three months later. During that time, our family eagerly waited for our mother and father’s return.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy father was drafted to military service just two or three days before the A-bomb dropped in Hiroshima. Later, I had heard that he was exposed to the-A bomb at the Western parade ground near the hypocenter. He was heavily injured and passed away on August 8th at an elementary school where he was housed. There were only two or three survivors from that unit.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter losing my grandmother and father, and mother still not found, I did not know what to do. I was only a child. I also lost most of my friends. Thinking about my classmates who became victims of the bomb that day, I felt an irresistible desire for studying. I had never felt like this before. Although I strongly desired to go to school, I had to give it up and work at a hair salon to make a living. I worked very hard to raise and live together with my younger brother and sister, but we eventually got separated. I was so disappointed and heartbroken that I almost lost my hope to live.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was still not able to give up my mother. With a last bit of hope, I kept waiting for her. Twenty years after the war, I was surprised when my uncle showed me a letter which my mother left for him, as well as some bank account book and national bonds which we had during the war. My mother had given this letter to my younger sister Nobuko, when she went to our uncle’s house for evacuation. A sense of nostalgia evoked, and I felt the deep affection of my mother. I wanted to blame my uncle why he had kept this letter secret to me for such a long time.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt was much later when I truly accepted my mother’s death. My friend found a name at the cenotaph for A-bomb victims which was only one letter away from my mother’s name. I assumed it was her. I picked up her ashes and buried it in our family grave.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSixty years had passed since the end of war, but my thoughts for my mother still lingers. Please allow me to post my mother’s last letter and her will, to express my heartfelt condolences. </p><p class=\"body_en\"></p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\nMy dear Nobu, </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nPlease open this letter if you find myself and your father dead. Please show this letter to your uncle in Tanbara. You don’t need to open this letter if we are alive. Because this letter is all I have for you. If we die, and you have to live on your own, you will need your relative’s support to look after Tadashi, Chisato and yourself. When that time comes, please give this savings to your relatives to use it as expense to raise you and your younger brother and sister. So if either myself or your father happen to survive through the war, please burn this letter away. I wish I don’t have to leave such a letter, but the air raid is getting severe and we have to prepare for the worst case. If we happen to die, please live strong and well. Please take good care of yourself and be healthy. Please become a person with conscience. Please be proud of yourself and please be proud that you are a Japanese woman.</p>\n\nTo my dearest Nobu, </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFrom your mother </p><p class=\"body_en\"></p><p class=\"body_en\">\n\n“Will”</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI am writing this note is to prepare for my death. I may die anytime as the air-raid is getting severe day by day. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nFirstly, I would like to sincerely thank you for looking after my dearest daughter Nobuko and her younger sister and brother. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn case myself and my husband die from the war, my children will need their relative’s support to live. I am leaving this savings deposit to help pay for their expense. Enclosed herewith the account number of my savings account.

However, I entered the training college of Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital for aid and nursing, since Miyazaki Prefecture at that time didn’t have one and committed Hiroshima to educate their nurses. It was the 4th month when I got bombed suddenly. I’d been isolated till then because I had dysentery.\nWe had a dry-run providing against getting bombed a week before, and the experience saved my life or whole my life.\nI was lying down on my back on the bed when a dazzling light flashed. I moved myself prone at once and then waited for help keeping space so\nI could barely breathe. In the evening, the staff and patient soldiers of the\nHospital ran to me and dug me out from under the wreckage following my voice. I was safe with little scratches on the left thigh. Couldn’t find my survival kit which had been at the bedside, I got out with nothing but the clothes on my back and found men’s shoes in a vacant house to wear. And then, came to a high street and didn’t know where to go. Because I told them I was suffering from dysentery, I was picked up on the truck to Ujina Port and was sent by ship to a quarantine station in Ninoshima Island. That night, the sky in the direction of Hiroshima city was bright red. A person came pick me up and I got back to Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital about ten days later. I heard that some had been staying in the branch dormitory when the fire had killed them in the evening of the day. Also, there was one who got bombed on the way back to the Hospital from Hiroshima railway station because of unexpected bloody stools. I would be much impressed by my own good luck. And I believe I could survive because my deceased grandmother was so pious that she’d prayed for divine protection morning and evening. I’ve been grateful for her in my heart.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the way back to the Hospital from Ninoshima Island, on the bridge, I was astonished to meet people whose whole bodies burned with their lips peeled, or whole body hideously festered. Within Hiroshima city was nothing but burnt-out ruins and I could impressively have a far distant view. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA few days after returning to the hospital, I went home in Miyazaki, where I\nwas believed to be missing already. Everybody was so glad about me alive. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nSixty years has passed quickly since we got bombed. I wonder at my having been in good health up to now. Currently I have the job of fortunetelling and I’m involved in consultations of many people. A former nurse is now an active fortuneteller. In spite of my age, I’m living a busy, fullfiling everyday life these days.\n</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

Just a little while after arriving at my office in Higashi-kanon-machi(an eastern streets of Kan-on area), there was a sudden air-laid alarm went off, and quickly after that, a bright red pillar of flame shot up out the window, and the building fell down in an instant (just like a flashlight of magnesium for photography) and smashed us. Though couldn’t move at all for a while, I tried moving myself and going through the heap of wreckage somehow. I crawled and crawled under timbers with my friend who had been sitting next to me, got out at last after long hours; don’t know how long. It was dark outside and drops of something like rain were falling. I kept running like hell toward the west, to get Koi-area, my home. On the way, I looked around the city all burned down, saw very few human figures, however, barely arrived home wondering what was going on. My mother had believed I was dead till\nthen, so she was happy and relieved. The smoke of burning bodies been seen since then for many days, at the riverside of Ota-gawa had made me feel gloomy. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThough I suffered from diarrhea and anemia with some cuts and bruises\non my arms and legs, I became calm gradually after moving to Sato-cho(the suburb of Hiroshima), where my elder sister lived and fed me fresh vegetable. I felt terribly sorry that, accidentally on that day of August 6, tens of stout workers of farmhouses near my sister’s had been called into labor service of building demolition in the city from early morning, all to be killed by the bomb. I felt really bad toward them because my life was saved in spite of my staying originally within the city. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAn atomic bomb is really terrible. It destroys hundreds of thousands of\npeople, buildings, and causes after-effects in the future; I am overwhelmed\nwith fear of it and I hate even speaking the word “Gen-baku” or A-bomb even today. There are some nations around the world which study producing nuclear weapons. I want them to recognize that they should give huge loss and misery to the world of our time, deeply considering what Hiroshima and Nagasaki had experienced. I cannot help praying that the young people with future will have no misfortune and live in the peaceful world. It is unforgivable that they see as horrible sights as Hiroshima saw or worse.\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

The Captain, First Lieutenant Kagami and his party (of about a hundred soldiers, I think) gathered at Inari-machi town at first and waited for another mission. Later, we worked of relief activities. Now that all the military facilities in Hiroshima city were completely destroyed, thousands of soldiers of each parties under the Ship Headquarters were at this operation.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe state of the bombed city was just beyond description. To hear the\nfirst voice  in the city, “Mr. Soldier, water, please give me water”, our party members came to ourselves. Many fellow soldiers of mine started to suffer from diarrhea 5-6 days later, and those with serious condition went back to the camp about a week later including me. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nIn order to start for a regular training at 8 in the morning of 6th, we were gathering at the barrack-yard when a roar like a rolling thunder and a\nflash like a lightning ran from ground toward the sky.

From 1954, lived under medical treatment for 20 months because of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n1.

Two mobilized students of my family (my younger sister and brother) are still in bed. Since the classes of my College of Engineering started, I leave for the campus in Senda-machi(now in Nakaku) after breakfast served by my mother. Have no idea that five of our family will be separated forever after that. \nSoon after seating at the desk near the windows of right side of the 2-storied wooden school house, there is roaring of B-29. A blinding flashlight and a deafening roar ”Boom! ” come at the same time. The building is swayed greatly. Got hit directly by big one? It creaks and almost collapsing. The path toward the left side stairs is already blocked with students running down. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI quickly decide to jump (out of the window). Pretty high from the ground, though, it’s better than to be crashed under the building. Jump. I think I faint for the moment, but come to soon. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nCan’t stand up easily due to a heavy blow on the waist. See the 2-storied house of the Mechanical Engineering Course is crushed to nothing, so\nstart walking to get out the building quickly. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt outside the school gate, you can see on your left, northwestward, flame\nblazing up all around and there filled with black smoke. Approaching and entering the streets in the direction of my home seem to be out of question. Many fragments of glass have embeded deeply in my left hand, and the bleeding doesn’t stop. No hope to find a first-aid station. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nCome down to Miyuki Bridge. Many wounded have collapsed on the ground at the west end of the bridge. Fortunately I see a military truck with the injured fully loaded stops at an uphill road, and I ask them a ride and get on. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe truck runs toward Ujina. I take a boat at the pier for military use and after 20-minute sailing, land on Ninoshima Island, wherein the army’s\nquarantine station is. The small island called “Little Mt. Fuji of Aki(old name\nfor western Hiroshima)” is now littered with so many people seriously burnt\nwhose skin stripped off and sagging, so I can’t find anywhere to put my feet. All the wounded who are laid on straw mats can hardly move. It’s amazing they’re brought here from the city in panic. No one’s going to deal with me as such slightly injured. I feel ashamed, however, will they treat my hands somehow? </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSoldiers only apply white ointment from a bucket with a big brush on the burnt people. Soon it grows dark, and is also a hard task to take in all of\nthe wounded. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe are crowded into a room with straw mats spread out on the floor. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’m laid down on the mat with seriously burnt people shoulder-to-shoulder, whose skins are stripped off. In the darkness, only groans. Looking at the person next to me, the eyes are filled with pus and a maggot is crawling around them making sounds. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nCan anybody go home alive, actually? </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI myself become worried about my home and family, and want to leave by\nthe first boat tomorrow morning. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI landed on Ujina on the following day. I walk barefoot streetcar streets,\ncross the Miyuki Bridge to get close to the city. What a horrible sight! You\ncan have a sweeping view to the mountains out the city. Crossing Yorozu Bridge, enter Tenjin-machi. The scorched earth burns my soles and I cannot stand. Walk stepping over carbonized bodies. Arrive in my home town at last. Go look in an air-raid shelter dug at the river side near my house. Several charred people are hanging from a burnt pillar fallen. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nToo scared to look and check their faces who they are. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt the site where there used to be my house, everything is buried under the burnt soil and raises about 1 meter high from the ground. I’m seized by uneasiness all at once; to where all my family have fled for safety.\nMy uncle comes over from the direction of Aioi Bridge and we meet each\nother. As he says, he found his wife and youngest daughter burnt dead when he went home from work. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nImmediately I become worried about where to sleep tonight. My uncle\nsays there’s the house of  his wife’s parents in Gion-cho(suburb of Hiroshima), so we walk to Yokogawa railway station and then take train to the town. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe had waited for a few days, but heard nothing from my family. It\ndoesn’t seem real to me that 5 of my family are all dead. I decide to dig the\nruins of my house, borrow a shovel, and head for Nakajima with my uncle. My family supposedly had finished breakfast just before the time 8:15 on the day, so I dig into the heap of ashes and ruins around used-to-be kitchen with a shovel.\nI hear a clicking sound and look down to find the oil-soaked soil and quite a\nfew of white ashes or bone-like stuff among it. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHaving no good container, I pack my family’s ashes into an empty can and\ndecide to bury it at the temple. About 1 km walk brings us to the graveyard,\nwhere our family’s tombstone is totally blown away. I raise the burnt black\ntombstone with my uncle and lay the ashes into it. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn August 15, the war ended. The long battle was over and Hiroshima was destroyed. They say no trees and plants will grow for another 75 years. I am alone finally. I wonder how my father is in Manchuria. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nAnyway we’ve got to secure place to sleep for now. Talk to my uncle, get some advice and build a shack at the site of burnt house. “The country is destroyed; yet mountains and rivers remain.” The river become clear, and you can see mullets floating with their scales burnt. Roast them as a side dish. Looking up in the midair at night, bathing in a drum, you can see the moon shines. There is no other person as far as the eye can see. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nOn one day in October, having bloody loose bowels for long, I feel so bad as just before collapsing.\nThere is no place to live in Hiroshima city. I decide to go to the home village of a worker of my family’s store asking him/her for support. Then I move to Shobara-cho village. The family is so kind to me. I realize that I’m getting better day by day exchanging my mother’s evacuated kimonos or clothes for rice.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn April 1946, I return to the College which resumes classes at the former Navy facility. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWith an introduction from my acquaintance, I ask a family for my lodging at\nKawajiri-cho on the Kure line. (The College returns to the original site in Hiroshima city in a year.) </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn February 1947, my only relation, long awaited father comes back from Siberia at last. Although I cannot help crying for joy, my father seems considerably shocked by the news of his destroyed family and doesn’t feel like live in Hiroshima. He goes up to Tokyo depending on his acquaintance. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI again become by myself.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn March 1949, graduated from the College. Living my life is becoming increasingly severe after losing the war. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI go up to Tokyo following my father to rebuild our family of two. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nThe sacrifices an atomic bomb made are too huge to bear, but I make a resolve to live with grief and rage. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe profiles of my family fallen victims. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nYoshiko, mother, age 38, housewife. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMichiko, younger sister, age 14, 3rd grader of public girls’ junior high school. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOsamu / Hajime, younger brother, age 12, 1st grader of Shu-do junior high school. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nHinayo, grandmother, age 55. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nYaeko, youngest sister, age 6. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nTwo mobilized students(1st and 3rd graders) are supposed to be at work\nbut they are bombed at home because of the factory’s regular holiday. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy grandmother and the youngest sister had been evacuated to the country till August 3, when they came back in Hiroshima to help removing things from our house, and they had bad luck.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt 8:15 of August 6, 1945, five of my family seem to be killed by the bomb in a moment at home in Nakajima-hommachi, Hiroshima. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn the scene of my house was a heap of burnt soil, and a few days later I dug with shovel where there seemed to be kitchen. I could find too little white ash-like stuff among oil-soaked ground to distinguish if it was for one person or more. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nRecently it was reported that 20,000 remains were found in the dig site of Ninoshima Island Home.\nNow that I also spent a night with the seriously injured in there, I’m\noverwhelmed by a flood of emotions. If my guess is right, they could hardly\ncremate the bodies because of too large number of deaths. I pray their souls rest in peace heartily. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAn A-bombed country could never take the attitude as “Unquestioning follower of the United States”, like that of today’s Japan.

While many large cities in Japan had been dropped\nbombs, Hiroshima had no air-raid experience even though it had been the biggest city in the Chugoku region. The wonder was gradually weakened and my cousin evacuated from Kagoshima to our house, and thus, we were under an illusion that our city was safe. Our house was nearby the Minami-danbara railway station of Ujina line which was the second stop from Hiroshima, and was in Danbara-nakamachi area in one-line distance of 2 km from the hypocenter.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">It was a hot day from early morning. At 8:15 in the morning on August 6 1945, an atomic bomb exploded 600 meters above in the sky of Hiroshima. Being a 1st grader of junior high school under the\nold system of education, I had been mobilized to a demolishing work of\nobstructive buildings to make a military road and a fireproofing zone. However, on the day, I had stomach trouble and told my mother about that. Then she told me “It is not studying at school, and it’s especially hot today. Stay and get rest today,” and made a bed for me at the passage side of the room facing the yard. Her words “Stay and get rest” saved my life.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I laid myself there and was chatting with my mother at the opposite side of the passage. At the moment, a strong flash as if the sun had fallen down covered us. Slightly remember that we talked like “That’s weird, fire bombs in the morning.” A few seconds or a few minutes passed. I woke up to find myself blown to the opposite side corner of the 8 tatami-mat (about 12 ㎡) room, with the summer coverlet covering from head to toe. My mother was under the fallen fusuma, or a papered sliding door. Taking a look around, all the window glasses broken, pillars folded, the ceiling curved as if it were blown upward and we could see the sky because the roofing tiles were gone. Although the tatami floor was covered with broken pieces of glasses, I got only 3 scratches on the arms and a injury on the right shin thanks to my summer coverlet. My mother was bleeding from the head though the fallen fusuma avoided some fragments of glasses.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Then, the 5-year cousin who was playing outside jumped in. He seemed to have very little burnt and scratches. My grandmother, staying in the back room, was also safe.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Without knowing what had happened, I went out the house and saw the houses in neighborhood destroyed as ours, and a hut over the Ujina line running near our house was in flame. I thought that we were directly bombed at first, but not really. Feeling uneasy, wondering why, we had spent about 2 hours when a crowd of strange-look people were coming with wobbling step making lines from the direction of Hijiyama hill, which was 500 meters away from our home, with a park on top of it. The people approached our house and collapsed on the ground one after another as though they felt relieved to come to a place which was not burnt. \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The figures or the shapes of them were awful and beyond description. Their clothes are burnt in tatters, with their burnt and festered skin sagging from the barely-clad bodies, and are walking toward me with their arms half-lifted in front of the body, just like an image of ghosts; I guess it’s because if lower the arms, they touches body and hurts or something. And burnt skin was also sagging from the arms. Their heads were scorched black with their hair burnt into a frizz; part above the neck looked like one black clod. Among them was a person who was pushing in his/her eyeballs jumped out and such sights you wouldn’t believe real were seen all around. \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">By noon, the roads near my house had been overwhelmed with those people. The air was filled with unusual smell of scorched human skin, groaning was heard here and there, so I felt so uncomfortable to stay still inside that I dragged a middle aged man with extremely severe scald into the entrance. As he wanted water, I gave him tap water which was slightly available. Then he might feel a little calm, so he wanted me to write down my name and address to come back for his thanks. Though I refused and told him not to care, he insisted on it, so I put a note with my information into his hand. He seemed relieved, grasping it tightly, breathed his last peacefully. It was the first experience for me as 13 years old, to face a death of man.\nIn the afternoon, troops arrived for aid, however, they also had burnt on the\nlimbs with their clothes burnt. They had no good medicine and were putting oil-like stuff on those with scald. Clearing up the bodies started, and I was also called on it. When I touched the limbs of bodies, the burnt skin stripped off. Being said we’d better flee from danger, the three of my mother, cousin and I evacuated to a field of grapes several kilo meters east from home, leaving my grandmother who insisted to stay. There were many people taking refuge, and I was encouraged seeing normal-looking people. \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">On the way from home to flee to the grape field\nwas filled with collapsed people with terrible scald and injury ; some were\ngroaning, some craving for water, some clinging to my legs asking for help, and the others unmoving dead. I fled stepping over and passed through those people. Wishing that I could help, though, there was nothing I could do, I could only run crying. When I recall that, the regret of running away doing nothing to them breaks my heart. It was under abnormal circumstances, however, I don’t know how I kept my sanity. We slept out the night in the grape field taking refuge. The only food available was grape above head, and we lived on it.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">When we went home (the next day), my father had\nalready been back home. Since the day before A-bombed day, he had been to the San-in area on business and so escaped danger, however, he rushed back home in hurry hearing that Hiroshima was terribly attacked, as he said. When walking along the railway track because the steam train had stopped halfway through, those who were getting out of Hiroshima told him about the 1st grader of the junior high at demolition work being all dead, and so he’d given up on me until he saw me safe and got delighted.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">My grandmother and the cousin passed away one\nafter another by the end of the year because of radiation aftereffects, maybe because they had less resisting power. My injury in the arms and shin were festering for months, and I got maggots on accumulated pus. A scar is still left on my right shin, when I scratch it feeling itchy, some liquid comes out even now. A while after the exposure, my hair fell out and I had the bleeding gum for several months.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">People call A-bomb “Pika-don(flash and boom),”\nhowever, I clearly remember the intense flashing, but nothing about a boom or wham sound; maybe it was too big and beyond our hearing limit or was not heard above other sound of breaking things around me. And I have no memory about a mushroom cloud either; were we too close to watch?\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Talking about “no memory,” though I remember about when I was bombed, I have very little recollection about while 6 months after the attack. There was a gap of memory --- how we made a living, couldn’t eat slightly remained rice covered with glass pieces, what we eat, how we lived in the house with holes in roofs and with broken pillars and window glasses, or how we fixed it, and what about the school --- I have no memory about these things. I myself don’t understand why.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The sights of many deaths in my sight, the scene\nof soldiers carrying the bodies to the nearby school and putting heavy oil on the piles of them, and the corpses to be burnt without human dignity even their names unknown, haunted my memory as a boy; I can remember these spectacles vividly even now if I close my eyes. I can’t explain why the vivid memories and blanks coexist in the period.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Sixty-six years have passed since I got exposed to\nradiation. But the tragedy is not over yet in Hiroshima and in Nagasaki. Some are worrying and hiding their old scars of glasses or keloids, avoiding telling their families that they’re radiation victims, some fear that their children or grandchildren might have the effect, and some are struggling against cancers developed some decades after the bombing. What is horrible about A-bombs is the damage of blast and even more than that, the aftereffects that last for many decades or hundreds of years.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">For Abolition of Nuclear Weapons \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Only about 228 thousand Japanese as of today have\ndirect experience of radiation exposure of A-bombs in among 6 billion people on earth. We, Hibakusha have responsibility for telling and recording the reality of harms of bombing as survivors’ missions. The truth of horrible facts of radiation exposure has to be understood by people across the globe in order to lead us to abolition of nuclear weapons. The number of Hibakusha decreases every year and the damaged victims will gradually disappear, however, we have to organize and broaden the network of Kataribe, or experience narrators. The U.S. President Obama said, during his speech in Prague, Czech, in April 2009, “as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act.” And he stated “clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.” I think it was an epoch-making event that the U.S. President referred to the responsibility for A-bombing in Hiroshima and in Nagasaki for the first time.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\"> Since several years before the speech, the knowledgeable and the Nobel Peace Prize winner had been suggesting nuclear disarmament and abolition one after another, like as the collective treatise of former Secretary of State Kissinger titled “A World Free of Nuclear Weapon.” And yet, North Korea alone recklessly made a nuclear testing, however, the world trend is toward the nuclear elimination for certain. Japan has to walk at the head of it.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Today, the nuclear arsenal that nuclear nations\nkeep amounts to 20,000 or even 30,000, and if they were used, the human race would be surely on the way to collapse. Of course the peaceful world with no war is desirable, but even if it happened, no nuclear weapon to lead us to ruin should be forgiven. People on this planet should remember forever that they’re evil tool which cannot coexist with our future.\n</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

It was an incident that human race had never even imagined before. It changed my life totally. In order to consider what the atomic bombs had done to human beings, I’d like to begin with my own experience of suffering from bombing.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I was a 16 years old junior high school student.\nThough I was mobilized to work at an arms factory, being a regular holiday of the factory on that day, I got bombed in the yard of our home which was at close range of 1200 meters from the hypocenter. Soon after I heard a roaring fighter, the strong impact of the blast suddenly flung me aganinst the ground. In the pitch-dark, I couldn’t see even my hands, being disabled to stand up by great force pressing me, I crawled out desperately. After a few seconds, inky-black grains of dust had risen into the air like crazy. (Though we had no idea then, it was probably radioactive dust and ash.) Gradually it became clearer around, and I saw there were no town in my sight, but all the heaps of rubble and broken woods of houses instead. Also, I could see fire had broken out here and there. \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Ladies and gentlemen, can you imagine; the city\nwas broken down in an instant by the enormous destructive energy complex of shock waves, bomb blasts, heat rays and radiation which the atomic bomb emitted at the moment of explosion. But that was a fact.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">My mother collapsed and couldn’t move herself,\nbeing pressed under our house fallen down on her. I tried to help her out, but a single teenager had nothing to do. A firestorm was approaching with awful speed and force, and the sparks of it were blown to us. As I told that to my mother, she said “Then you run, now!” and began to say her prayers. Hearing her voice, I left her who would be burnt to death, and ran away. Wasn’t she shouting at her heart, “Gods and Buddha, please help.” How regretful she was! \n</p><p class=\"body_en\">A few days later, I dug up a corpse-like thing of\nmy mother at the ruins of our burnt house. It was an oily and slimy object like as a mannequin doll covered with coal tar and fired. It was hard to believe it to be my mother’s body. She was killed not as a human being, but as an object. The deaths of atomic bomb victims in Hiroshima and in Nagasaki were far from those of humans.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">When I was to run away saying good-bye to my\nmother, I was already in a sheet of fire. I was saved because I could reach and jump into a trench for fire-prevention made in middle of school yard of Sanyo Junior High School which was just behind our house. It really was a miracle. I saw a person who arrived at the edge of the school yard just a little later than me, perished in flames. No one could go and help. Like this person, even if they could managed to get out from collapsed houses, I saw everywhere around, many got trapped in a raging fire and got burnt dead in fire protecting water tanks attached to the houses, getting close each other. What the most people witnessed on the day were a cruel and inhumane happening and merciless, horrible sights; --- “the heaps of red severely scalded swollen corpses, bodies with the eyeballs or internal organs jumped out, charred train-cars, those who were burned alive trapped under fallen houses (like my mother), processions of ghost-like people having their hair stood on end, with their skin stripped off and sagging. Hiroshima and Nagasaki had changed in an instant into such cities of death.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">My sister, 12, a 1st grader of a girls’\njunior high school was, by orders of army, called out to help building\nevacuation and at work near the hypocenter when bombed. It seemed that, with injury, she managed to escape, and thus we don’t know where she died; she’s still missing. Of course it was wartime, but I can’t help but feel intense resentment against the war which caused even 12-13 year-old boys and girls mobilization and miserable deaths, against the nation which had started it, against inhumane A-bombs or nuclear weapons which violate international law, and against the country that used them. About 5000 teenagers had passed away without tasting sorrow or joy of youth.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I became “Genbaku-koji,” an A-bomb orphan because my father had died of illness in May of the year. Though I recognized that my sister was dead already, I walked around Hiroshima city tracing her. After a month, on September 6, I felt extremely sluggish as if I were drawn into the earth while wandering the ruins of fires as usual. I hardly arrived my aunt’s (sister of my mother) home which was in the suburb, 10-km away from Hiroshima and where I had taken refuge, when I fell down. I got red spots in the limbs and the whole body, couldn’t swallow enough food due to my sore throat and had a bleeding nose and gums. Also, my hair fell out. I was suffering from acute radiation syndrome by the A-bomb. My aunt who lost her husband made desperate effort and found a dentist, who treated me with injection for days. I again miraculously recovered.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Just after the bombing, when A-bomb victims needed medical measures above all things, Swiss medical Dr. Junod who sent to Hiroshima by International Committee of the Red Cross got surprised at the terribleness of damage of it, and he requested the U.S. occupation army for international rescue which refused. The Japanese Government sympathized with the U.S. occupation army’s policy that they would conceal the actual condition of A-bomb sufferers not only from the eyes of domestic people but also from the international society and that they ‘d deny the ask for international help. Our government didn’t make an objection against that, nor requested for rescue, and let the victims die. The government has to take on responsibility for its inhumane measurement to meet the victims’ situations as well as starting war which caused A-bombing. I do not know what kind of treatment I was given then. However, the fact I experienced suggests that if we could have received relief from abroad at that time, hundreds of thousands of victims could survive for some more years, and that makes me boiling with rage. The reason why I dare to claim that now is because I think the country’s basic posture of “neglect Hibakusha policy” in those days is still consistent today: underestimating the damage of A-bomb and acceptance of the damage---Just be patient. I cannot overlook the posture like as “The A-bomb did no great harm,” because such attitude will lead you to the approval of nuclear arms; “Oh, it can’t be helped if it’s dropped again.” I think this belief is the starting point of the Hibakusha’s long years of appeal for abolition of nuclear weapons never to make another Hibakusha, and of the claiming for A-bomb damages against the country.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">I had suffered from various illness and health disorders afterwards. However, furthermore, the atomic bomb aftereffect has attacked me without mercy; since several years ago, I’ve been developing cancers resulting from late-onset radiation poisoning one after another, and under medical treatment, I’m joining the campaign of Hibakusha.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">My experience of exposure to radiation is merely\nan example of hundreds of thousands of the victims. Not all of them were\ndirectly exposed under “the mushroom cloud.” People who entered the city to search for their family or due to rescue activities also got exposed to residual radiation both on external and internal body, breathing in radioactive dust or taking polluted food and water. Sixty-six years after the bombing, many Hibakusha who suffers from much more terrible damage than I still have guts to appeal for elimination of nuclear weapons --- “Never repeat what we experienced.”\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The A-bombed people got damaged not only on their “life and health.” We Hibakusha have been burdened with pains and hardship in “mind and living” through our lives. My trouble was nothing to other unfortunate ones. My aunt brought me up as my second mother after the radiation exposure. I could graduate from a university. But when it came to employment, my resume, personal history showed my coming from Hiroshima and on the interview, it became clear that I was Hibakusha. It was natural for the companies to avoid and discriminate me who had high risk of health disorder. Also, I didn’t have parents as guarantors; an aunt was no good in this. The obstacles to my livelihood and discrimination weighed on my mind. Although thanks to a professor of my university, I could proceed my way to a scholar, it was such hard days as if climbing up a steep hill for me who didn’t have chance to study during the war. I could live through the time somehow supported by my wife and many other people around me. And when my first daughter was born, what I asked the obstetrician was “Is the baby healthy and normal?” I clearly remember the answer “She’s alright” made me so happy to tears.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Among those who had exposure radiation, there are\na lot of people whose lives were totally upset by losing family, and also\nhaving health problems, who have suffered various social discriminations, and who gave up on their marriage and having babies due to their exposure to radiation. Besides, many deaths of children and grandchildren of the atomic bomb survivors due to leukemia or cancers have been informed, the cause and effect relationship left unexplained.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Thus, Hibakusha have led our lives with\nsuch burdens feeling as if we were not be allowed to die or live as ordinary\nmen do. However, with heavy loads, we have also\nfought to recover our dignity as man and human rights. We have requested the country and have achieved better support for the radiation victims and the progress of the policy, leaving something to be desired, though. And also, our claim and voice of “Never more nuclear war” and ”Abolish all nuclear weapons” linked the peace-loving people around the world and that has greatly contributed to avoid the crisis of nuclear wars or usage of the weapons ever so many times.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">You may be wonder why Hibakusha keeps trying their best that hard. The reason is because we strongly believe the damage we had should never be repeated on our descendant, or on everyone of you, or on all mankind. Never on you, or you, or you.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\"> Another difficult matter appeared in front of us\nwho have aged and are less active than before.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">As you know, an earthquake of magnitude 9 shook\nwide-ranging area of East Japan and huge Tunami followed in March this\nyear(2011). As an aftereffect of them, the Fukushima No.1 nuclear power plant had major damage which they hardly managed to deal with in the emergent situation. I have to say Japanese people had experienced four times of serious radiation harms; Hiroshima, Nagasaki, a Japanese tuna fishing boat, the Daigo Fukuryu Maru exposed to the U.S. thermonuclear test near Bikini Atoll in 1954 and the disaster at the nuclear power plant this time. However, if the power company and the government make a single mistake in dealing with the accident, Japan will, this time, fall to be an assailant country which spreads radiation harms around the world.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">You may think these two are different kind of\nmatters; one is the damage by nuclear weapons as war injury and the other is that of nuclear power plants caused by a natural disaster. You’re right. But please consider carefully. Both disasters had happened as a result of human beings’ application of science and technology.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Human history has led us to the opening of “the\nnuclear period” with technological innovations like developing, producing and practical use of new weapons or nuclear ones as a turning point. And “the nuclear power” appeared spotlighted with a stupid term “peaceful usage” as a new energy source applying nuclear fission technology in place of coal and petroleum. Natural science is entirely outside my field. However, seeing from the eyes of social sciences or just from those of common folks, there must have been a trap deriving from overconfidence in science and the new technology and from economical benefit and effect-first principle. There left strong doubts that they had careful views enough to expect disadvantage (harmful phase) to human body like as nuclear fission or radioactive matters, and that they prepared and established a well-laid management system for the nuclear power generation when “the peaceful usage” was insisted on. I expect that, when the matter of conversion from nuclear power is discussed, the country should examine with Hibakusha’s wish on nuclear abolition in mind.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\"> The world-famous politicians and many other\nknowledgeable people like U.S. President Obama and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, made encouraging speeches purposing “nuclear-free world” and that has driven the movement of abolition of nuclear arms lively. Let’s think about President Obama’s slogan, it is “Yes, we can.” It indicates “I will do it, but I can’t make it by myself.” and ” We have to get together.” I agree with that. Without public opinion and support, no nice plans could turn into reality, even influential people appeal. It is us seeking peaceful future who can decide if we will perfectly secure the safety of nuclear energy abandoning nuclear weapons or if we will choose new natural energy as a replacement. The future of mankind depends on us. To fulfill our mission assigned by the time, let’s get together and try our best.\n</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

We attended school at 8:00, made lines on the playground and then started practicing flag signaling. In those days, many children had poor nutrition because of food shortage, students collapsed one after another being overwhelmed by the strong sun. And so, we were going to take some rest for a while in the shade of trees. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nVigorous boys who were still in the middle of the playground then,\npointed up in the sky and shouted, “Look, B-29! B-29!” (The American bombers B-29 had been seen flying above Hiroshima sometimes, to let the sirens go, children knew them very well.) When I looked up, I saw a silvery shining B-29 flew, drawing a curved airplane track high up in the clear blue sky. As soon as I thought “Beautiful!” a white light flashed in an instance. I was rushing toward an air-raid shelter when the blast squirted me in the back with hot sand of the sandbox, and I fell down.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI reached the shelter with other students to find it full of neighbors, so we stayed outside soaking wet with the sudden rain---what is called the Black Rain later. I felt so cold that I trembled violently.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere was no more sun but the grey clouds hanged low. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nBecause my town wasn’t burnt out, those who fled from the center of the city and who got scald filled all the streets within, leaving very little space to walk. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy father, who got bombed at a school building 1 km from the hypocenter and was helped out from under the collapsed building, came home bloody with glass pieces stuck in whole body. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy eldest sister, who got bombed on the platform of Hiroshima railway station which was 1.5 kms from the ground zero, arrived home in the evening of the next day having a burnt from neck to back. Having no medicine, our mother cooled her with sliced cucumbers. The cool reserving vegetable went bad quickly because of the heat and smelled enough to gather flies, the family waved a fan in turns to avoid them to settle on her wound. My sister only cried repeating “It hurts.” </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe 13 year old sister of mine was absent from the school (mobilization) on the day feeling sick, and escaped death. On the day, all the students of her school who were called out to work in the center of the city passed away. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMost of the families in our neighborhood had victims in their members; some had never come home since the day, the other came home injured and with burnt. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy friend with whom I usually played was waiting for their mother with 4\nbrothers and sisters. On the following day, a four-legged black stuff, which\nthey thought as a black dog in a moment, jumped into the house, and as soon as it came to the children, fell down to floor; it was their mother. The children cremated her in the garden. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt my elementary school, on about third day, people started gathering bodies covering the streets and digging many trenches in the schoolyard then burning them. We smelled it in everywhere in the town. According to a record, about 2000 bodies were burnt. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOn August 15, the war ended, however, we were still facing food shortage as before. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the next spring, at my elementary school, we planted sets of sweet potatoes in the playground. And later on the harvesting day, we heard a scream here and there every time someone dug potatoes with human bones followed. We were not able to eat the sweet potatoes served as lunch.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The first two atomic bombs were dropped in\nHiroshima on August 6th, and in Nagasaki on 9th, and over 600,000\npeople combined got exposed to the heat rays, to the blast and to the\nradiation. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Forty-two percent of hundred forty thousand people\nin Hiroshima and seventy thousand in Nagasaki who passed away by the end of the year were still missing.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Most of us Hibakusha, or victims of radiation\nexposure can’t forget the voices and aspects of people who asked us for help even after 64 years, they’re remaining in the heart as a pain.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Besides, many are suffering from diseases supposed to be aftereffects of radiation, being always worried.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI keep telling and sharing my personal experiences of A-bomb explosion, wishing that people around the world would learn how massively, without distinction and mercilessly a single A-bomb kills and destroys a city in a moment.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">We Hibakusha call nuclear weapons as arms of\ndevil. And it is impossible for us to allow even one to exist on earth.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">They should be abolished for the sake of peaceful world in the future.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The A-bomb damages that you must never repeat.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">The sorrow of the victims on that day that you\nmust never forget.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">Nuclear arms that you should never allow to\nexist.\n</p><p class=\"body_en\">We Hibakusha appeal to people across the world for\n“No more Hiroshima, no more Nagasaki and no more Hibakusha.” </p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

As for me, being a second grader at an elementary school, I got bombed in a classroom of the wooden schoolhouse. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy father came to the school to see me and I went home on his back. On the way home, I saw a hell, or something you wouldn’t believe it belonged to this world. At last I reached home whose roofs blown away by the blast, window glasses broken into pieces, and some of them were sticking into the walls, floors and the furniture. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe government says the “Black Rain” ranged to 29 kilometers northwest of the center of the city, and we had the big drops of fallout containing sand, dust and soot with high radiation without mercy even inside the house. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAlthough I’d been to Honkawa Elementary School, 300 meters from the hypocenter, till a month before the day, due to the compulsory evacuation of buildings in urban area, we’d moved to the\narea which was 3500 meters away from ground zero, and I could survive\ntill today. Had it not been for the building evacuation, all our family would’ve been killed with no human shapes remained. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe atomic bomb thrown on Hiroshima exploded about 600 meters above the ground with a blinding flashlight. Its large amount of radioactivity, severe heat rays and the blast of explosion injured and killed people in an instant, and demolished the city. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNot only the directly exposed to the A-bomb, but also many of those who entered within the city for rescue or search family members or friends after the bombing lost their lives suffering with acute radiation symptom as loss of hair, bloody discharge, purple spots, and so on. The internal residual radioactivity harms their health so immeasurably that, even today, there is no end to the number of people who die of cancer, leukemia, etc. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nA lot of neighbors of our former house nearby the hypocenter and our relatives came to us to take refuge. Among them was my dearest cousin. She was said to have been working at the place that’s 500 meters from the ground zero. The half of her face was hideously burnt with the skin stripped off, and so as on her back through the right leg. It was boiling hot summer. The wound festers quickly, flies come to lay eggs, and then appears maggots crawling on her body. All I could do for my favorite cousin is to pick the worms and wipe her body fluid. She was complaining “Ouch! It hurts!”, but the voice weakened gradually.\nI think it was in the morning of the 3rd day when she passed away in\nmy arms at the age of 14. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAnother cousin of mine, who was the 5th grader (10-11 yrs old), was\nhaving loose bowels despite he had no injury or keloids. One day, he suddenly bled at the nose and ear, coughed up chunks of blood and died. Furthermore, my uncle, aunt and many others lost their lives one after another by the end of August. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI believe that these people were killed by the atomic bomb due to the war. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSince then, the A-bomb has kept suffering me. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen my applying for a job and getting married, I faced discrimination and\nprejudice against Hibakusha; people who got exposed to radiation. When I became pregnant, the worries that I should not give birth to my baby distressed me bitterly, for the baby would be a child of Hibakusha. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMany Hibakusha had to give up their marriage due to the other side’s opposition, or rather remained single in those days. Even if given a baby, they repeated miscarriages or stillbirths. And even though some of the babies were born safely, they died of sickness very young. Hibakusha was then suffering with these facts. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe have been troubled by the problems of “heart, health and living”. This is how and why more horrible the nuclear arms are, far worse than ordinary ones. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe most harshest thing to me now is about my daughter. She was unexpectedly seized with a cancer, and had an unbearable major operation, having decided with tears, believing her recovery. After the surgery she was having treatment and working with rehabilitation, with both bodily and emotional pain, worrying about the redevelop and metastasizing of cancer. However, she was suddenly gone, it was been 4 months since the outbreak of her cancer. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWhen I conceived her, worried about the effects of radiation in the future, and now I lost her to whom I gave birth with resolution. Though I’m in a sorrow and vexation in my mind every day, I’ll try to go forward positively because I believe my daughter is always beside me, cheering me up. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt is not yet proved that the children of Hibakusha have high risk to get\ncancer. But it became clear that radiation affects on human genes. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nSimply because we are Hibakusha, we worry, suffer, grieve and get angry at every turning points in life even over 65 years after the bombing. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nSuch experiences should never be repeated on you, nor on anybody else in this world. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt is human beings to start a war and to use nuclear arms. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nAnd also, only we human beings can stop a war and abolish nuclear arsenal. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’d like to make efforts to keep telling the realities of radiation exposure as\nlong as I am alive, wishing that we, as soon as possible, will be able to pass on the clear peaceful sky without warfare nor nuclear weapons to our children. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNo more Hiroshima. No more Nagasaki. No more war.\n</p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

My father was a doctor of internal medicine, and also an army surgeon. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAlthough I grew up in a happy family, the disgusting atomic bomb changed my life completely. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nOur house broke down and only the air-raid shelter in the basement was\nleft. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDue to the lack of medical doctors, we were prohibited to go out of Hiroshima city then. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nDuring the war, fighter planes B-29 always circled over the city of\nHiroshima day and night but flew away with no action. And then the air-raid\nsirens became no astonishing to the citizens and they got accustomed to stay in the air-raid shelters or dugouts. (On the contrary, for us little children, it was a fun time, if I say.) At the moment of the atomic bombing, I was at the villa of my mother’s parents, which is in Osuga-cho, 1.6 kilometers away from the hypocenter. There, I got bombed with the family of my grandfather but I escaped death. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the morning of that day, it happened when people were feeling confused\nand unsettled just after the removal of an air-raid alarm. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI don’t remember what happened immediately after the attack of atomic\nbomb. When I came to myself, family members except my mother stood in amazement in the rubble of collapsed house. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI was astonished by the strange darkness at even before night and the\nqueer, indescribable smell. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy grandfather, who was outside the house at the moment, was still\nalive with his whole body burnt, but his skin stripped off groaning. I dreaded to watch his state of injury and had no idea about what had happened at that moment. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThe difference between my grandfather and us who were both bombed\nwithin the same site shows the peculiarity of nuclear weapons. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nMy deceased uncle was exposed to some heat rays despite that he was\nindoor; he was at the window.</p><p class=\"body_en\">\nWe fled to Onomichi city in Hiroshima pref. which was my mother’s\nbirthplace, with Uncle’s family, taking wounded grandfather. Not sure the date nor time. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy mother seemed to walk around the Hiroshima city in search of her\nhusband after making sure of her children’s safety. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nMy father was going to see his patient in the neighborhood of our home with a nurse when got bombed. The nurse was blown away by the bomb blast and is still missing. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter got bombed, my father visited Imai Clinic in Midori-I cho, Asa\ncounty for help and was lying on the bed, worrying about our safty. It was in the morning of August 9, 3 days after the attack, that my mother and father came across with each other. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nSo as others, my father had his whole body burnt with swollen red face\nlike an Aka-Oni, or a red devil that appears in Japanese fairy tale. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nThe words of his last moment were “Unbearably regret my dying. Please guard our children.” </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAt the night of 9th, my father breathed his last. It was the end of his short life of 42 years, and my mother was 33 at that time. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI wish I could ask my father----“How burning hot would it be!?”, ”You must\nhave wanted to live so much more!”,and “What were you thinking and feeling at the last moment?” I can never ever forsake these atomic bomb victims who died cruel deaths like him. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAfter his death, my mother cremated his body in the field, came back to\nus bringing a litter medicine bottle with her husband’s ash in it. She told, “It\nwas impossible for me to cremate totally. So I left a part of your father in\nHiroshima.” </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy mother is still well at the age of 99. She is a brave person. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nHow was she feeling when decided to go back and look for her husband in\nsuch situation? It weighs on my mind to think over her who has spoken nothing about that. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nMy grandfather fled to Onomichi with us and laid himself in a big\nBuddhist alter room of the house, groaning “it’s hot, so hot.” Although our\nfamily looked after him altogether, he became unspeakably smelly, flies came to him and appeared maggots that we tried and tried to remove from him but could not make it. The bugs bit my grandfather and suffered him. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI thought in my childish mind, “I can’t stand to watch him anymore.\nWish he’d gone soon.” As an 8 year-old, I couldn’t control myself with the\nsight and the odor. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nNow I feel so guilty about my foolish thoughts. On August 12, my\ngrandfather departed to another world. I would say he fought his best for one week. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nThere are many A-bomb victims in my relatives. The brother of my father\nlived with his family in Senda-machi (middle of Hiroshima city). His family\nwere killed instantly at the bombing except one of his daughter, my cousin, who had been away from the city due to the evacuation of school children. She is so-called an A-bomb orphan. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAnother (older) daughter living with our family, who was a mobilized\nstudent, got bombed at the work place---died at the age of 14. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nThe situation of those war days did not permit us the citizens of\nHiroshima or Nagasaki, even to survive. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nAn ugly atomic bomb greatly changed my life. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIn the land of Hiroshima city, lots of bones of the dead are still in the ground. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI ask people to walk around the Hiroshima city thinking of and feeling\nfor them. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nPlease listen to us “Hibakusha,” the a-bomb victims of radiation sickness. I’m asking every one of you to pay some attention to us. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nIt’s been 66 years since we saw the unparalleled horror in human\nhistory being attacked Hiroshima and Nagasaki with the first 2 atomic bombs in the world. Hibakusha have long suffered from mental and physical aftereffects and so they will till the end of life. What I want to appeal to the younger generations are the true facts and the fear of radioactivity; nuclear weapons’ peculiarity. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’d like to warn the society and to sleep forever after watching abolition of nuclear weapons on earth with my own eyes.\nThe government has long kept saying that we the victims of atomic bombs\nand airstrikes should accept our war damages, which THEY brought us, and they don’t seem to change their attitude. We can never accept such tragic harm on us because that means we allow another war. </p><p\nclass=\"body_en\">\nHibakusha have become great age till now, no one knows how long we will\nsurvive. </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nI’d like to entrust my activity to the next generation. Please receive our\nbeliefs and do your best for the sake of the young who support the future.\n“A conflict occurs in human mind, so peace should be created in the\nsame place.” </p><p class=\"body_en\">\nLearning about Hiroshima and Nagasaki equals thinking of the future. </p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",

I used to be a cheerful girl living in good health. On the day, my father and brother also left home with vigor. I was in front of the house of my friend Yukie who I was going along with well like as my own sister to go to school together, when I saw the flash and got blown away by the blast. Yukie and I fell senseless for a while, which we didn’t know how many seconds. We were brushed aside in a dark hole dug beneath the floor. Yukie who had been\nin front of my eyes was stuck under the iron-beam and couldn’t move. We heard a lot of screamings from outside. We also cried and cried to ask for help. </p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">In the meantime, my mother noticed me and called me to come out quick, but I was too little to reach the ground level. My mother brought a ladder from somewhere and put it down to me. Yukie is repeating “Go quick, run” in a thin voice. And my mother is saying from above “It’ll be a sea of flame, so move quick.” I left my dear friend Yukie alive to let her die, and ran. It was so sad, bitter and hard and since then, I’ve been carrying a huge cross- I couldn’t help her. I will never be able to forget it. And my 5-year older brother who gave me lots of love got directly bombed and died at a point of 1 km from the hypocenter. </p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">The deaths of these two have been my sorrow, pain and regret that I can’t wipe these feelings from my mind. Also, Both my parents passed away in agony; my father having glass fragments in the body, and my mother having exposed to the radioactive Black Rain. </p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">Back to me, the sight I saw above the ground on the day after crawling out was like as a picture of inferno. What I’d seen on the way to flee with my mother, being caught in the Black Rain comes back alive in my memory. I had an acute radiation syndrome in the beginning, then the more diseases I suffer from as I get older. Although I got married seeking for happiness as woman, since I had a miscarriage, the relatives of my husband abused me saying ”Can’t A-bombed woman even bear a child?” Those words spiritually distressed me and it came to a miserable end. I’m living a lonely life by myself having no one to depend on. </p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">Thanks to the medication, my physical condition has been calmed down so far, however, I take so many medicines as to think of finishing them sometimes. Sometimes there is a moment that I even don’t want my life. </p>\n<p class=\"body_en\">Sixty-six years have passed since A-bomb attacks, but 220 thousand people who exposed to radiation in Hiroshima and in Nagasaki are leading their lives feeling uneasy - emotional scars, problems of health and welfare etc. which are ready to occur at any moment. Even now there are wars in somewhere in the globe. War results in nothing but tragedy. Thinking over important lives of each victim, my heart aches endlessly. Various countries have lots of nuclear weapons. We don’t want such dreadful bombs as to destroy large number of people in an instance. Never should be used one. I wish the Nuclear Free World, and wish no other person would never experience the bitterness of radiation exposure. And I pray for the everlasting earth with blue sky and for our peaceful lives. </p>\n</div><div class=\"reference\"><p class=\"reference\">The Hachioji Hibakusha Association</p></div></div>",
